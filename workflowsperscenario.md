traditional workflow vs. new workflow

### research publication

traditional workflow vs. new workflow

Text-centred works, with additional illustrations / videos / resources online, and extended referencing and/or indexing
Traditional, print oriented workflow: see Kimmy's visualized workflow for the INC, which will be generalized for research-type publications

* Editor works with author(s) on manuscript  
* Several versions going back and forth between different people in different roles (editor, author, copyeditor, designer)  
* Final version of the text will be in a text editor or Word format  
* This is then designed in InDesign  
* Corrections made on the print proof and added in the InDesign file  
* Certified PDF goes to printer  
* How to make an e-publication from InDesign - this is the big problem. Going from InDesign to ePub is not easy and needs a lot of handywork

This is why the new workflow is directed towards hybrid input and output - which leads to a workflow that is also hybrid, but centred around a single 'archive format' - the definitive version that enables multiple output. So instead of having a final text file (e.g. Word) which is changed in InDesign - both of which are not good formats to convert to an ePub, the storage / archive file has to be in a format that can translate into InDesign for the print edition and ePub / mobi / web for the e-publication. The most suitable format for this is html - because it allows footnotes (which Markdown does not). The html can easily be converted to ePub, though not so easily to InDesign... (working on this)
