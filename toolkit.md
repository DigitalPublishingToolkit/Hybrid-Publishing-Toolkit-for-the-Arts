# 01 Introduction 
'You must change your life' - borrowing from philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, this could be the summary of our message for art and design oriented publishers, writers, editors and designers who are transitioning from traditional book making to electronic publishing or - more typically - hybrid print and electronic publishing. Hybrid publishing will sooner or later confront them with the following: (a) rethinking of traditional publication formats (eg a catalog), (b) rethinking of editorial and production workflows and (c) rethinking of distribution. The changes that need to be made might be greater and more extensive than initially expected! 


*Change is minor for scientific and mass publishers*

With that said, there are exceptions. Workflow changes can be minor for publishers who already accomplish all their editorial work in highly structured digital document formats (such as XML or databases); but typically, this is only the case in scientific and technology-oriented publishing. Changes might also be minor for larger publishers that can afford outsourcing. Making an electronic (digital) publication next to a printed publication then is simply a matter of paying an external service provider such as a document engineering company or a media design bureau for turning a Microsoft Word or InDesign file into an ebook. This process can be quick if the book is visually simple - such as a novel or a textbook with little illustrations - and economic if many ebooks will be sold. 
<!-- margreet: can we mention a rough time indication here? -->

*Change is major for small, arts-oriented publishers*

Since this Toolkit is for publishers who (a) publish visually oriented books in (b) mostly smaller print runs, it proposes an alternative route. Neither a complex internal IT infrastructure, nor costly outsourcing will be viable solutions for them. But, to disappoint a common expectation, there is no magic software button that will turn a print book design into an electronic publication. Since the two media are so different, with their own specific editorial and visual design needs, such a button will probably not materialize in the future either. Hybrid publishing will ultimately require editorial work to change, both technologically as well as editorial concepts are concerned.

For art and design publishers, the challenge of going electronic with their publications is greater compared to other fields of publishing for a number of reasons: 
- visually oriented publications are still more difficult to technically realize in the electronic medium when designing for a multitude of different reading devices and ebook platforms; 
- small publishers are under high pressure to keep project costs low due to often smaller budgets - but having to publish in multiple forms (e.g. print and electronic) will increase costs unless one accomplishes as much work as possible in a way that is not the dependent on the medium; 
- To make the investment in a digital publication durable it is necessary that electronic publications are sustainable: they should not need constant investment into technical maintenance and version updates.

## Industry promises versus reality

We face a major contrast between computer industry promises and the reality of the new digital medium. On the one hand, publishers, editors, designers and artists tend to overestimate the interactive and multimedia possibilities of electronic publishing. These extra possibilities do exist, but in most cases cause higher development costs and remain
specific to one particular technical reading platform.

On the other hand, publishers tend to underestimate how even technically simple and seemingly banal types of electronic publications can force a rethinking of traditional publishing formats (such as: the anthology, the catalogue, the periodical). Rethought formats may be the greatest opportunity offered by electronic publishing: for example, splitting up a traditional exhibition catalogue into interrelated micro-monographs that people can download and read as individual ebooks.
<!-- andre: the later aspect could be further developed, so that it gives a more positive and exciting tone to digital publishing. Before jumping to the example one could speculate about the possible transformation of traditional publishing formats brought by digital publication.
-->

## What this Toolkit provides

Going electronic - or going hybrid - means that you need to change the way you work in the publishing process from manuscript to publication. The software tools currently in use, from word processors like Microsoft Word to desktop publishing suites like InDesign, were created for the analog or desktop-publishing world. Although it's possible to create electronic publications from Microsoft Word [![Bloglink](../images/_in_progress/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/03/28/converting-a-docx-directly-to-epub-using-calibre/ "Link to blog post: Converting a DOCX directly to EPUB using Calibre") and InDesign [![Bloglink](../images/_in_progress/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/05/21/epub-development-in-adobe-indesign-cs6/ "Link to blog post: NOTES ON EPUB DEVELOPMENT IN ADOBE INDESIGN CS6") files that are likely the standard in the current publishing workflow, it will be painful, slow, inefficient and expensive in most cases. This Toolkit describes technical Do It Yourself (DIY) alternatives because it is primarily aimed at publishers who, in most cases, cannot afford to outsource ebook design to external service providers and furthermore it is aimed at those who want to keep the process in their own hands. 

This Toolkit has a particular (but not exclusive) focus on EPUB3 as an electronic publication format and on Markdown as a word processing format because of the specific needs of small edition publishers in the art and design field: low cost, ease of use, sustainability and
platform-independence. The recommendations stem from our practical experience in collaborating with four Dutch art, design and research publishers on electronic publication projects.



## Whom is this Toolkit written for
You may be a publisher, a designer or someone who is just starting out with making books. You probably identify with or work in the arts. You may hope to gain answers, knowledge, get tips, and consult various resources. This Toolkit intends to provide them all. The overall focus is on pragmatic solutions for publishers within the art and cultural sector. No prior knowledge of creating an ebook is required ‚Äì with that said, a familiarity of various computer software is helpful, as is the willingness to learn and the inquisitive curiosity to look beyond this guide for certain answers. This publication is not a tutorial on how to make an electronic publication, it merely intends to give the reader guidance on how to make a first attempt at creating an electronic publication.

As mentioned before 'you must change your life', so there might a little culture shock reading through this document. If electronic publishing will merely remain an afterthought in the production chain and product portfolio, the change might be light. If electronic publishing will become just as important as print, the change may be radical. What this means is that if you want to make visual electronic publications, you should be willing to change your current way of working and gradually get used to the offered but less common alternatives.



## How to use this toolkit 

The Toolkit aims to provide a practical guide on how to develop electronic publications
for publishers as well as for anyone else interested in this subject matter. It will attempt to give insight into the preconditions of electronic publishing, providing open-source tools where possible, and allow publishers of the art and culture sector to navigate the diverse and complex landscape of digital publishing in a more informed way.
Furthermore, the Toolkit will help the reader to develop epubs, specifically art and design
publications, which generally make more use of different fonts, graphics and layout than text-dominant publications. 
Chapter 3 will give a general introduction of these publications and sketches out various scenarios on how to develop epubs. Issues and opportunities of going electronic will be discussed, as well as strengths and limitations of particular reader hardwares and softwares, file formats and lastly distribution platforms. Chapters 4 offers a practical, how-to guide to workflows (both structured and per scenario) and designing electronic publications for the various scenarios addressed earlier in Chapter 3. Chapter 5 illustrates the concepts with concrete examples from the Digital Publishing Toolkit project.


## Who worked on this Toolkit

This publication is part of the Digital Publishing Toolkit [![Bloglink](../images/_in_progress/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png "Link to blog post")](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/ "Link to blog") research program, based on recommendations from practical experiences throughout the collaboration between two applied universities, four Dutch art, design and research publishers, graphic designers and software developers.



# 02 The Basics
<!-- Andre: my over impression of the chapter is that it confuses the reader more than it clarifies her about essential concepts for the following chapters, such as
* plain text files
* html
* markdown 
* css 
Maybe these concepts could be made more tangible with examples, how the same content and formatting are represented in both html and markdown.

* mentioning SGML seems besides the point since the reader probably wont ever touch it.
-->


Although there are no stupid questions, there may be times when one is hesitant to ask questions in situations where the people around seem to be in the know already. In this section we try to explain the fundamentals of electronic publishing in order to help the reader formulate questions more precisely.


## What is a text?
<!-- Marc: This section is in need of some references. For example, the usage of word spaces in ancient texts is a bit more subtle, if I understand correctly - i.e. Latin and Greek uses an interpunct to divide words. -->
A text is a collection of words and words are compositions of letters. In order to read a text we have all kinds of layout helpers. Keep in mind that in the Roman times (when texts were cut in stone) there was continuing writing: no spaces between the words. This was not considered a problem as reading was a craft only a few people mastered. These people knew the words and hence were able to read aloud, just try: *Icanreadthiseasilyaloud*. In time, the craft of reading became a common good and many design/lay-out helpers were introduced, for example spaces between words, capitals at the beginning of new sentences, commas, semicolons, colons and line breaks. Furthermore,  the notions of paragraphs, chapters and the like, developed into a standardized system that allowed for a smooth transmission between the structure the authors endowed their text with and the readers who became familiar to these standards. Thus enabling ease of reading and the possibility to read silently.
<!-- Marc: I can't find the definition for markup, not sure if adding reading aids constitutes as marking up a text. The practice of 'marking up' historically comes from paper manuscript authors and denotes revision instructions and various remarks in a more or less standardised way. -->
This structure of stratifying words into sentences, sentences into paragraphs and so on, including reading aids such as exclamation marks, bold and underscored text is called **markup**. It goes without saying that all these **markup** elements demand stable definitions and clear relationships. Everybody is free to invent their own rules (e.g., every first letter of a new chapter is a well-decorated small picture). For example, in the time of handwritten manuscripts many ‚Äúfree style‚Äù inventions were made. Some of them remained in our time and became part of the expended alphabet. Think of the ampersand ‚Äú&‚Äù, it originated from the conflation of the letter e and the letter t ‚Äì we call this conflations, *ligatures*. To define what we allow and what not, **Markup languages** emerged.

Markup languages are grammars that define the markup and the relations between markup elements. With the emergence of computer networks and the increasing need to standardize texts for multiple usages, an international ISO standard established in 1982 is called: Standardised General Markup Language (SGML). This logically structured markup language was a big step forward as it made a fundamental split between the text structure as such and the final representation of that structure. For example, contrary to languages used in word processors such as Tex, LaTeX, Word, Microsoft Word, Wordperfect or ODF (open office document format), where presentation and text structuring are mixed, SGML only defines functions or roles. When we type a **bold** word in the text using a word processor we in fact type ‚Äústart bold‚Äù -\> type the word -\> ‚Äúend bold‚Äù. 
![your caption here](../images/_in_progress/03_1_intro_mixture_layout "MIXTURE")  

What is happening here is a mixture of **layout** and structure. Layout is the activity of presenting a text onto a medium, such as a paper page. SGML and its derivatives, the easier **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) and the expanded **XML** (Extensible Markup Language) make a strict distinction between structure and representation. <!-- Marc: I think I know what's meant by the following sentences, but the meaning might not be all that clear to the casual reader. --> A markup language knows notions such as ‚Äúhighlighted word or phrase‚Äù and then type 1,2,3... This allows you to equate e.g.: chapter heading with type 1 and quotation with type 4. Depending on the output substrate you can then define in the layout phase how this will look like. For instance, a chapter heading is in a certain type font and font size and centered on the page, whilst a quotation is represented in the same font size and font of the running text, but now in italics. On a screen we can have things like chapter headings in pink and quotations in yellow. This freedom in the layout is explicated in a so-called **style sheet** <!-- Andre: mention CSS, as this the how style sheets are commonly known -->, which is a table that connects a layout schema with the
markup schema. This way of working is imperative if one wants to allow a source text to be represented in many different ways on various media of various sizes. Note, that in many programs these translations are done fairly invisibly to the user. If we translate an .odt file into a .docx file,  all coding is translated one-to-one. As we will see in the following, translation between one file type into another is not always symmetrical. Hence, the golden rule is to **always make sure that the source text is as systemically structured as possible**.

An important notion is that all digital texts and accompanying coding are written in simple letters and numerals, this is called **flat text** <!-- andre: do you mean "plain text"? -->. This is a stripped down text without layout; the most elementary token. It goes without saying that the flexibility of this process is limited to the character set for flat text we use. In the ‚Äúold‚Äù days this was **ASCII** based and limited to the possible number of distinct signs (letters, numerals, commas, etc.) of a binary computer text. Slowly but surely, a new list of allowed signs, based on ASCII is making inroads. These signs are called: **Unicode**. Unicode aims to include all alphabets and letter systems including common signs and ligatures, such as the aforementioned & and diacritic signs. Again, this is a step forward to guarantee a clean source file for all kind of usages, even those we don‚Äôt consider or even imaging today.
<!-- Marc: Do we need to mention imaging, it's the first time this is mentioned? -->
<!-- Margreet: Maybe there is an image we can inser like the Tim Beners Lee 'cake' image, so the various sing languages are being put in perspective? If not, also ok. -->

### What is an electronic text?
An electronic text is normally understood as a text which is represented on a screen of some sort. Of course this is sloppy language. The key issue is that an electronic text became a structured file in which the emotions and intentions of the author are translated into notions like highlighted text of a certain type through the work of said author. Due to this markup, we become able to make different layouts, expressions, onto different media.<!-- Pia: Joost kun je het voorgaande misschien iets specificeren? de link tussen de author en markup is mij nu niet duidelijk-->  It is of great importance to note that electronic publishing introduces a big shift away from the page centered culture of book printing. Book printing allows for various  printing sizes depending on the wishes of the author, designer and publisher. For example, when making an art book based on a collection of paintings or drawings, a decision can me made on what the ideal book size is and whether or not it will be printed in oblong form or not. In the world of screens these types of decisions are different as we have very different sizes of screens. No screen can be cut to the demanded size like with paper book publishing. In electronic books we have to work around things in a completely different way to the paper world. This means that the transposition from an existing work to an electronic representation is rife with difficulties if the structure of the texts and, in particular when the relation between illustrations and running text, is important. In the world of text based publications (novels, research publications) there generally only is running text. For these publications the page size is less important and this is part of the reason why ereaders are becoming increasingly popular. On electronic reading devices the text can always be made to fit the size of the device, this is called **reflowable** text. In all other cases, the creator (publisher, designer, etc.) has to consider how to design the work and under what conditions content and meaning are represented. This will be discussed in the following chapters for various outlets, as one might opt for various versions of the original work. It goes without saying that in the coming years, authors and designers will try and develop digitally conceived works that intrinsically allow for a variety of representations depending on the reading device whether electronic or not. 


## What are electronic possibilities?
Novel electronic capabilities enable a great number of possible publication outlets. Before entering into the problematic aspects of such a plurality of presentations of the same message, we investigate the possibilities. As with all technological possibilities; the coin has two sides (leaving aside the unstable rim) which exclude each other. The printing press introduced pagination and indexing, allowing many thousands of identical texts to be read and compared by an expanding group of readers over the years, independently of location. In an electronic world with non-fixed screen sizes this is complicated. On paper text is fixed, this allows for comparisons and interactions between different readers separated in space and time. In an electronic version the fixity of the text remains, as the text file is independent from its final substrate (E-ink, lcd, paper), but its presentation on to the final substrate can vary substantially. Think about the introduction of numbering phrases in the Bible, which came along during a ceremony when the priest wanted everybody in the audience to read at once, however as the formats of the Bibles were non standardised, page numbers were of no help. <!-- Name: is there more information to back this anecdote? e.g name of priest, year this happened? -->
<!-- Andre: maybe present the same publication in different devices: desktop computer reader, smartphone, e-ink device, so that reader grasp the mutations that a publication can suffer from device to device. -->

The challenge becomes even greater if we widen our ambition to pictures, audio and video, hyperlinks, etc. In the Toolkit project, we deal with the field of books in the arts. This category of books integrates all aspects of text-only publications but expands it with visual information that can be explanatory of the text and, more importantly, to visual information which can be a 'stand alone' statement. In such cases, text, helps the 'reader' (viewer) to have an understanding of and have a deeper appreciation for the object. It is clear that various forms of art books demand and enable different electronic representations. In these books we witness a crossover between the primary importance of text and image.
<!-- Margreet: Is video also covered here? -->

As cultural standardization over the centuries rendered, for example, a detective, religious or an educational book instantly distinguishable by its typography and layout, - this too will also become a fact for electronic books. Apart from the electronic (or paper) book as a 'object d'art', electronic art book publishing will have many commonalities despite its difference in genre. A major issue is that the electronic sub-structure makes all files just bitstreams (streams of binary code: zeros and ones). The digital files containing the various kinds of information are all equal on this level of digital bitstreams in the computer memory: merely standardized code. The great new thing in the world of electronic art books is that based on standardized, though well tailored structures, the creative message can be published in a great variety of ways. This not only depends on the capabilities of the output (reading/viewing/listening) device, but also on the function of the book for the author, in a present context, such as a dictionary, a study, a reference, a coffee table book, or a leisure book. The same source can and will be represented differently under different circumstances. All these vistas demand a thorough and more labour-intensive editorial and production strategy. Not only because the same source can express itself in various output forms but even more so because once properly edited and stored electronically, information and its constituting parts can be reused and used in different ways, to be decided upon given a specific environment of goal, now and in the future.
<!--Andre: Does the above paragraph belong to the Basics chapter? Seems too speculative for here.  -->

<!-- Silvio: Here I'd maybe add that these possibilities require more work for all the parties involved. An example comes from web design: since the advent of responsiveness the work of designers doubled. -->


# 03 Genres of Publication

In the present project we deal with various kinds of products which we combine into five genres: 

 1) Research publication;  

 2) Art/design catalogue;  

 3) Artist/designer book;  

 4) Art/design periodical;  

 5) New genres of publication.

<!--Margreet: Should be make a connection here to our own examples used in the DPT project? -->

##1) Research publication 

- Heavy in use of text;
- Texts take a central role;
- Visuals are secondary (images refer to texts);
- Often longer texts;
- Often with a standardised structure;
- Often with complex referencing (footnotes, endnotes, cross-references, citations, bibliographies, keyword and name indexes, list of illustrations, glossaries, table of contents).

**Going electronic: Advantages and issues**  

<!-- Silvio: I'd begin with the advantages in the mundane activity of quoting a text, made immediate thanks to copy paste.
Another obvious but crucial advantage is search within the text.
Another possible advantage is to embed the datasets employed in the publication itself.
Referencing is still an issue as there is no standard way to specifiy che location of the reference (no fixed page number anymore)
A mention of open access might be worthwhile.
Finally, commenting and annotating and sharing these annotations is a problem as  they don't stick with the book as it happens with physical books. 
Miriam: Great additions, I wrote them into the text. Also, changed Issues and advantages to Advantages and issues Margreet: So this item can be solved / deleted? Maybe good to do so, so the text stays clean?-->

Advantages of going electronic with publications presenting research are first of all obvious for users: firstly, an ebook allows for copying (and pasting) text in an easy and natural way which has been long desired by researchers, students, and  readers alike. Secondly, an obvious but crucial advantage is the possibility of searching within a text. Thirdly, a possible advantage is the posibility of embedding the **datasets** employed in the publication itself. For publishers a huge advantage has to do with the wider reach and availability of the content. Making the text available digitally will increase its spreading, not in the least regarding international outreach, as the ebook offers no limitations on availability. Open access publishing further changes the question of availability dramatically.

Issues which specifically relate to digital research publications lie in referencing. With fixed page numbers no longer there, there is no standard way to specifiy the location of the reference. Worth extra thoughts are setting the parameters for the use of and interaction between text and images within a publication. 

Going electronic also opens up new possibilities for creating content. Due to the high level of standardised structure, a 'modularization' becomes possible, thereby allowing to go beyond the traditional way of essay writing. In particular when authors refer to each other, they often share data, quotations, tables, figures, et cetera. Multiple use and reuse of 'modules' will enormously enhance the communication within a community. However, this remains a future dream for now as comments and annotations don't stick with (a specific place in) the book like in physical books, which makes sharing difficult.[^Kircz]

##2) Art/design catalogue

- Heavy in use of images;
- Visuals take central role over texts;
- Visuals are primary (text refers to visuals);
- Descriptive texts of changing lengths.

**Going electronic: Advantages and issues**  

Most art/design catalogues are image-heavy publications, and this is precisely the greatest challenge for electronic publishing in this genre. Being an art/design catalogue, it is important that the quality of the images is high, with no degradation of colours and the highest possible resolution. This means that a publication containing a lot of these images will be very large in size, posing a problem when it comes to downloading speed, storage space on the user's device and on the publishers servers. This is an issue that begs consideration but as speed and storage space increase exponentially over time, possibilities grow parallel. 
<!--Margreet: Do we have more information about this? Maybe mention two examples, to give the reader an idea? --> <!--Pia: I dont think examples are needed. fine as is IMO -->
Possibilities in this direction lie in offering high quality images which can be zoomed in to and complementing the content with other (interactive) materials. Also, most tablet computers offer much more better color reproduction (gamut) than the print page. An issue of concern is that in a catalogue often a fixed page layout is necessary: image and text must appear in a certain layout as they belong to each other. However, changes in size (of the device or of the settings a reader uses) might influence the flow of content, resulting in a drifting apart of pictures and text. 

Just as with research publications, modularization offers interesting chances for writing and presenting material. As a catalogue is often built up around parts which are already modular in nature, there is a lot to be gained from using these features in electronic publishing. For example giving readers the opportunity to 'build' their own publication; publishing different editions (small, medium, large) of a catalogue without extra effort; easy updating of a part of the catalogue.


##3)  Artist/designer book

- Book *by* an artist, rather than *about* an artist;
- Complex use of images and typography, often pushing the possibilities of the medium;
- In print: making use of the book as a material, visual and haptic object;
- Difficult or impossible translation into other media;
- Text is often used in non-descriptive or non-narrative ways.

**Going electronic: Advantages and issues**  

As artists/designers books essentially represent a reflection around the medium itself, it is not a question of going electronic and considering the accompanying 'advantages and issues'. There aren't advantages or disadvantages in choosing a digital format or a print edition, it's a different choice that determines the artist book from the start. Also, choosing an electronic format like EPUB for an artist/designer book means to master the specificities of such formats. This seems to be one of the reason why there are few digital artists' books <!--Margreet: Can we mention examples here? Or can this be solved Sol LeWitt as well? --> <!--Pia: I dont think soll LeWitt suffices here, maybe a badlands example?-->, except for electronic reproductions of artists' paper books on such websites as Ubu Web and Monoskop.

When working on an electronic edition of an already existing print artist/designer book, the most important thing thus is the choice of the file format. The specifications of the format (and medium in general, as mentioned above) determine the end result extensively. Furthermore, here too, the quality of images and the relation between text and images is important. Where an artists' book is not primarily a reflection of its medium, and electronic publication of a book or pamphlet is principally not difficult (a good example would be Sol LeWitt's 1968 "Sentences on Conceptual Art"), advantages of digitalization are similar to those in other genres: the more elaborate possibilities offered in interactive material, outreach of the publication, reach of new audiences, and friendliness for reusing text and images.


##4) Art/design periodical

- Heavy in use of both texts and images; 
- Both images and texts take central role;
- Use of images is both primary and secondary;
- Texts of changing lengths;
- A more-or-less fixed page-layout format;
- Recurring publication format (e.g. magazines, series etc.).

**Going electronic: Advantages and issues**  

A periodical thrives well by its physical presence. It can be tossed in a bag and just as easily be disposed of. In a digital form, the physical presence becomes limited in this sense. Of course the digital domain offers other forms of 'nudging' and ways to keep a periodical present for the reader, such as push messages on tablets and smart phones, email notifications, and sharing via social media, but this is not quite the same. 

The archival aspect provides other chances and issues for digital art/design periodicals. New articles can refer to older ones and even integrate parts. The periodical as such becomes a repository and therefore a playground for new work. 

Advantages are mostly the same as with the other genres listed: increased possibilities in extending content (interactivity, video etc.); decreasing distribution costs; outreach to a large audience; modularity. However, storage and download/update speed present a challenge, as already mentioned above. 
<!-- Name X: One of the advantages in 3 out of 5 publication formats is that the content can be extended. It is worthwhile to state the fact that a heavy publication (with videos, etc.) is a problem from the point of view of 1. Developing countries, 2. Archive --> <!--Pia: Comment confuses me, lets discuss next week -->

##5) New genres of publication

New genres of publication are likely to emerge out of the ongoing digitization of the publishing industry. They could even fall outside of what we would normally consider a 'book', like short pamphlets, poems, essays, sketches, or - in the world of digital media - apps, a series of tweets, a blog et cetera. Or similar to adventure games, we can imagine the use of an interactive approach where the reader is able to control the narrative or to build or customize the publication. <!--Examples of such new genres are collected on the blog ???--> 
<!-- For example one can think of platforms used to collect tweets in book form or **tumblogs** in an epub as shown during the Off the Press conference. << Miriam: This is a meaningless reference for most readers... name the examples by name or leave out. Margreet: Is someone able to add these? --> <!-- Leave out examples completley, takes away from the ' lots is possible' feeling -->


## Three levels of electronic publishing

<!-- The goal of the project is to define a common ground for directions, strategies, and tools that will enhance the transition from paper-only publications to a mixture of paper & electronic publication, given the above listed genres of publications.
As the mindset of the partners in the projects are very diverse and in most companies the discussion is only in an early stage, it does not make sense to produce a matrix of all questions and all answers. A better approach is to try and sketch the overall picture, based on commonalities and diversions. This attempt is presented below. Miriam: this is non-information to readers of the manual who are not in the project. The general statements are already mentioned elsewhere--> <!-- afgreed let's delete-->

Independently of the different genres listed above we can sketch a basic picture based on commonalities and diversions. The scope of epublishing starts with simple conversions from paper publications to electronic ones, moving towards full-scale electronic publications.  

A division into three levels can be made, which are described in further detail below:

1. One-to-one; the book is considered a separate product where text-authors, illustrators, artist photographers, and designers work together to produce the book, which then is published and exists as a single edition. The print book can as such be translated one-on-one into an ebook. 

2. One-to-many; the publication has various chameleonic appearances, dependent on the context and available presentation media (type & size of screen/paper). In other words, a book is offered in formats such as print, EPUB, PDF, MOBI, web, and looks and works according to the format used.

3. One-to-database; here the book is not a separate, defined, and limited entity. A publication is put together out of various independent components defined as modules that can be used and re-used multiple times by whomever has access to them. For example: a reader chooses a selection of chapters on offer and gets an epub specially made in this occasion.

<!-- Margreet: @Kimmy & loes: perhaps the three levels can also be visualised?-->
![Three Levels of Electronic Publishing](../images/_in_progress/04_1_three_levels.png "Three Levels of Electronic Publishing.")


###1) One-to-one publications

On the first level, there is the unique book. Each book is considered as a separate product where authors, illustrators, artists, photographers, and designers work together to produce the book as a one-off team. The production workflow can be unique from book to book, but mostly is traditional, moving from manuscript to a designed PDF ready to be printed. Pictures and/or full layout pages do not work as reusable (digital) objects. In many cases no archives of the independent ingredients that together create the end-product are available. <!-- Miriam: I don't understand this coming sentence and think it might as well go: There are many common characteristics between books in one genre. Hence, the question is how we can reveal and define these characteristics to enhance insight in the nature of this type of book. Artist‚Äôs/experimental books are an obvious example of this kind of book.-->

Usually this implies that going electronic means making an erepresentation of the same book. In some cases files of the final pages or book are being converted into EPUB3 by an external agent. The final pages are checked on readability and the digital make-up (for example, that figures and captions are on the same page), and changes are made accordingly to create the ebook. On this level the ebook is not more than an exact-as-possible picture of the printed book. 

The publisher might use a document management system, which can be a mere collection of folders/directories on a hard drive. Archiving files is important for possible reprints. Sometimes publishers are forced to scan their own books in order to reprint them because they don't have an archived version of it. Herein lie great possibilities, because having an archive of semantically structured content allows reissuing the publication in efficient ways and in new formats not envisioned before.


###2) One-to-many publications

The next level presents a split between the manifestation of a (one) paper print version and (many) electronic versions. The electronic version, contrary to the paper version, is not a single object but has various appearances, due to different presentation substrates of electronic book formats. Furthermore, the sizes of reading devices are not standardized and generally allow for both portrait or oblong viewing. On top of this, the popular semi-standard EPUB3 allows for flowable pages and a change in font and fontsize.

Workflow schemes become very important when working towards a one-to-many publication, as the same texts and images are used in various outlets. A structured and detailed workflow, accompanied by a related descriptors (metadata) set is necessary. In such a way, the ebook is not a byproduct of the print book anymore, but is produced simultaneously in its different output formats.

###3) One-to-database

Database publishing presents the final level. Database publishing means that all objects or entities constituting a publication can be used independently and easily from each other. To that end they should be uniquely defined and stored in a database. As a precondition for full scale database publishing, the editorial workflow is important, because it is there that a decision is being made on what items are defined as individual entities and which characteristics and features (metadata) they have. 

Especially in publications which have a more or less fixed layout database publishing opens new ways of conceiving books. For example, in the case of a collection of essays readers are then be able to make a personal choice from the available texts. The same can be thought of in the case of catalogues and journals. Based on metadata a structured presentation of all material is made possible, allowing the reader to navigate and put together a collection based on personal interests. Of course this means that tagging, describing, and storing of all components should happen in the early stages of publication with utmost care. 
<!-- Miriam: I think this can be deleted here, I find it confusing even though I should know what this is about. The end of the paragraph is repetitive: the page-layout is of less importance compared to full colour art books; the accidental picture or graph can be easily accommodated. A series of essays (and blogposts) mimics a journal publication with more-or-less fixed lay out. After all, a new volume in a yearly series is only special the year of publication. Later on the essays of that volume are just one item of the collection (though with metadata indicating the year of publication and related details). However, in all instances the workflow demands for this type of projects might serve as an example for others towards a full database approach. This means that the workflow scheme must have such a coherent structure that choices are explicated. It is important to note that there will never be a one workflow which fits all but if the relevant metadata is available; publications in different forms can be created. --> 

# 04 Ereading technologies

![Digital Publishing Range](../images/_in_progress/05_1_rich_poor.png "Digital Publishing Range") 


<!--Amy: As I was reading this, it made more sense to me to change the ordering to: reader hardware, software, file formats ‚Äì as talking about hardware is much more tangible and gives a bit more bridge to then understand software and then the most abstract, file formats -->

##File formats
A file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. Technically, it specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium. File formats may be either proprietary or free and may be either unpublished or open. A specific file format demands specific programs to read it.<!--Amy: I copied (and edited) this text from the glossary as I thought it would be helpful to have a brief explanation about what a file format is before going into the history! -->

In this chapter the history and characteristics of various important file formats that exist for ereaders, electronic devices capable of reading digital texts, <!--Amy: I added some text here as I thought it would be helpful to repeat a brief explanation --> will be explained. The development of the modern ebook started with the _Open eBook_ specification and has thus culminated in an ebook format called EPUB which is currently at version 3 [![Bloglink](../images/_in_progress/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)](http://digitalpublishingtoolkit.org/2013/06/digital-publications-in-practice/ "Link to blog post: An initial overview of the digital publishing landscape").

###Reflowable documents (EPUB and AZW)
The history of the modern ebook can be traced back to the late 1990s with the establishment of the *Open eBook Forum* tasked with the creation of the *Open eBook Publication Structure* (OEBPS). Microsoft was heavily involved in the development of what became the *Open eBook* based partly on technology created by a company called SoftBook Press[^businessweek-ebooks]. SoftBook Press developed the format, based on [XML](#XML) and [XHTML](#XHTML) <!--Amy: Tried to link to chapter 11: glossary but not sure if it's working. I feel that this should be further explained, or make a note to refer to chapter 06 where it's described in greater detail -->, as a companion to their ereader. The *Open eBook* specification had its first release in 1999 and was later renamed to EPUB when the standard reached the 2.0 version milestone under the auspices of the *International Digital Publishing Forum* (IDPF, formerly the *Open eBook Forum*) [^interoperability-of-ebook-formats]. The EPUB 2.0 standard has support for basic styling, custom fonts, etc. [^epub2-specification].

At the beginning of Amazon's foray into the world of digital publishing, the online bookseller chose not to use EPUB but opted to buy a French company responsible for the development of *Mobipocket* and the MOBI file format that also produced Mobipocket Reader software and an ebook reader for some personal digital assistants (PDA). One of the main reasons for this move was the widely supported [Digital Rights Management](#Digital Rights Management) (DRM)<!--Amy: Tried to link to chapter 11: glossary but not sure if it's working. I feel that this should be further explained: what this is or what the consequences are. e.g 'The practice is controversial as it often hampers paying customers in freely interacting with digital goods' --> engineered by *Mobipocket* [^amazon-aquires-mobipocket]. Technically, the MOBI file-format is partly based on *PalmDOC*, an ebook file-format readable on PDAs running the Operating System (OS) developed by Palm Inc., with added support for the guidelines taken from the *Open eBook* standard [^mobileread-palmdoc]. Mobilepocket and Amazon then developed the format further in order for it to be used exclusively with *Mobipocket* and, later, Amazon *Kindle* ereaders. The MOBI format is now called AZW (probably an acronym for _Amazon Word_) by Amazon, their generic term for all ebooks released by the company [^amazon-azw].

Nowadays, roughly two generations of widely used ebook formats exist. One generation is based on the EPUB 2.0 standard as introduced in 2007, or an earlier version released under the *Open eBook* moniker. Amazon's MOBI/AZW is an example of this, as it's still widely used and supported by the *Kindle* ereaders. The other generally implements features from the EPUB 3.0 standard, while often remaining backwardly compatible with older versions and subsets of EPUB 2.0 and even 1.0 to a certain extent. EPUB 3.0, released in 2011[^reader-specification], brought support for HTML 5 (as opposed to XHTML 1.1 in EPUB 2.0), more advanced styling using **CSS3**, scripting (discouraged in EPUB 2.0) and easy embedding of video and audio, amongst others [^epub3-changes].
EPUB 3.0 forms the basis of most of the ebook file formats available today. Most of the current file formats, like Amazon's AZW3/KF8 and Apple's iBooks, implement most of the EPUB standard, mainly to benefit from the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications, while adding their own proprietary extensions [^amazon-kf8], [^ibooks-author]. These extensions are mainly geared towards extra support for more advanced (fixed) layout options, rich media integration and DRM [^ibooks-photo-blocks], [^ibooks-multicolumn], [^amazon-kf8]. An AZW3/KF8 ebook is basically an EPUB 3.0 wrapped in Amazon's DRM. For backwards compatibility a MOBI version of the publication is generally also present in the ebook package [^azw3kf8-breakdown].


Of course EPUB 3.0 files without proprietary extensions exist as well and are sold to various commercial channels. In addition to their own iBooks file format, Apple also sells ebooks in their online store. [^epub-seller-apple] Other major players include Kobo, Google Play and Barnes & Nobles' NookPress [^epub-seller-kobo], [^epub-google-play] [^epub-seller-barnes]. [![BlogLink](../images/_in_progress/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)](http://digitalpublishingtoolkit.org/2013/06/crash-test-dummy/ "Link to blog post: Preliminary tests using a simple EPUB in order to establish support for various EPUB features.")


<!-- Margreet: an overwhelming amount of terminology and formats introduced. Perhaps we should introduce some terms earlier in the toolkit? --> 

<!--Amy: I agree with Margreet, there are a wave of new terms introduced over a very short piece of text. It is hard to get through it all without having previous knowledge or spending time in checking the glossary and references. So in conclusion i propose to link some terms to the glossary + reorder this chapter as mentioned in earlier note-->

###Other formats
The aforementioned file formats may be categorized as *reflowable* documents as they can adapt its presentation to the output device. There are of course other ways different ways to disseminate electronic publications, for example the fixed layout, which preserves the look of the original, complete with fonts, colours, images, and formatting. One way of doing this is exporting a document as a **PDF** (Portable Document Format), but there are also more content specific file formats like the *Comic Book Archive* [^comic-book-archive], however support for these file formats by ereaders varies greatly.

<!--Amy: here I elaborated on what a reflowable document is vs. what a fixed layout is. -->


##Reader hardware
There are several ways to peruse electronic publications. Portable devices like ereaders or tablets are by far the most popular gateway to digital content. Smartphones also offer some of the capabilities of an ereader, as most of these devices are a miniature version of their tablet counterparts. Lastly not to forget the desktop computer, which is often used in combination with the physical book, especially in the case of research publications.


###Ereaders
Ereaders became widely known with the introduction of the Amazon Kindle in 2007. Ereaders differ from tablets in the way that they are only suitable for reading books, are relatively cheap and have monochrome displays. An important characteristic of the ereader is the use of *electronic paper* (epaper), a so-called electrophoretic screen. Electronic paper is designed to mimic the characteristics of paper as closely as possible and is relatively low in energy consumption. The current generation of epaper is incapable of rendering complex motion, so animations and videos are impossible to use.

Both Amazon and Barnes & Noble also offer more expensive models, Amazon Fire (and Fire HD) and NOOK Tablet (and NOOK HD+) respectively. These models are not really ereaders anymore, but fully-fledged, small sized tablets. These models do not use epaper, but instead work with color LED screens with backlight ‚Äì a standard component of tablets such as iPad and Galaxy Tab. Often these tablets use a version of the Android operating system as its core, in contrast to the classic monochromatic ereaders using their own operating system built on a version of Linux. The Samsung Galaxy Note and Apple iPad mini can be seen as an answer to the smaller sized tablets.

Because of the lack of a color screen the current generation of ereaders is best suited for prevalently text publications, i.e. novels or research publications. 

![Strengths & Limitations](../images/_in_progress/05_2_strengths_limitations_04.png "Strengths & Limitations.")
<!-- Amy: note about image; i think the eye fatigue icons should be switched as it now looks like you'll get tired eyes from ereader as opposed to the other way around.  -->

###Tablets
The tablet-market is dominated by two main players, [^sales-figures-tablet] Apple and Samsung. Apple utilizes their own operating system (iOS) for the iPad, while Samsung with its Galaxy Tab product line has opted for Android. The Android-segment of the market consists of many manufacturers offering similar hardware with a variant of Android as its operating system. Several ereader applications exist for both iOS and Android, the most important ones will be reviewed in [the Reader Software]() section.

Apple's and Samsung's most recent tablet screens cover nearly the entire sRGB color space<!-- add to glossary -->, which makes their color reproduction as good as that of professional monitors for photographers and graphic designers, and yields much better color reproduction than print. The upside of the tablet's color screen is at the same time also its weakness, as backlit LED screens are generally known to cause eye fatigue. Furthermore, reading in the sun is problematic, because direct sunlight obscures most of the visibility of the screen. Battery life is another issue with tablets. Although newer tablet models often claim impressive battery life, ereaders still reign supreme with an average battery life of up to several weeks.

###Smartphones
The story for tablets also largely applies to the realm of smartphones [^sales-figures-phone]. Of course most smartphones have smaller screens than both ereaders and tablets. But the similarities between smartphones and tablets are large enough to justify clustering them with tablet devices. 

###PC/Laptops
Reading ebooks on a laptop or personal computer is a possibility but may be a less natural fit than handheld devices. A full range of software for ereading is available, but the same downsides of relatively limited battery life and increased chances of eye fatigue exist as with tablets.


##Reader software
Standalone applications for desktops, tablets and smartphones offer some advantages to the software present on ereaders. Firstly, almost all devices offer a full color display, as opposed to the monochrome e-ink screens of ereaders. Secondly, a lot of applications support a larger subset of the EPUB standard, which allows for more features - like custom fonts, layout styling, etc.

![Strengths & Limitations](../images/_in_progress/05_readersoftware.png "Strengths & Limitations.") <!-- kimmy: very rough sketch -->

###Mobile applications
There are many existing applications for mobile devices (tablets and smartphones). Some of the available software constitutes of companion apps to well-known ereaders, like Amazon's Kindle and Kobo's range of reader hardware. The other category contains applications which are not for available ereaders but often offer their own storefront, viz. iBooks and Aldiko. EPUB 2.0 and 3.0 support is generally available, but some of the applications require the user to convert files into a proprietary file format in order for the ereader to be able to read the document. Kindle is an example, as it only supports Amazon's proprietary file formats (AZW, KF8, mobi and txt) <!-- add to glossary --> and PDF.
<!-- Silvio: ‚ÄùAmazon's proprietary file formats (AZW, KF8, mobi ) along with txt and PDF. -->

####iBooks####
iBooks is Apple's ereader application for iPhone, iPad and Mac. Books may be bought in the iTunes Store or can be copied to the iBooks library. The latest version of iBooks offers support for many of the features of the EPUB 3 standard, but also PDF and the closed-source `.ibooks` file format (IBA) - a derivative of EPUB 3.

####Marvin####
Marvin is another application and one of the few paid entries. It does not offer its own store and is mainly geared towards managing existing collections of digital publications compiled from various sources. Marvin only accepts EPUBs and offers to convert incompatible file formats using third party software package [Calibre](#calibre).

####Aldiko####
Aldiko is both a storefront and an ereader for Android which supports EPUB and PDF. As such it is comparable to Apple's iBooks. There is a paid version which offers some extra features (annotation, removal of advertisements) which the free version does not offer.

####Kindle####
Kindle is Amazon's tablet and smartphone counterpart to their physical ereaders (Kindle Paperwhite, etc.). The application is available for both iOS and Android. Books can be bought from inside the application on Android. On iOS it is less straightforward due to the restrictions Apple places on in-app purchasing. Kindle for mobile devices only has support for Amazon's proprietary file formats (AZW, KF8) and PDF. EPUBs have to be converted using software, for example Calibre, in order for Kindle to be able to import the files into its library. The application is able to sync its library so that a collection of ebooks is available on both the Kindle ereader and in the application. It is not possible to copy-paste. 

####Kobo####
Kobo, like Amazon, produces ereader hardware and also has a large bookstore. As such the apps they offer for Android and iOS are largely complementary to the ereader companion devices manufactured by Kobo. Libraries are synced across devices, provided all the content is bought in Kobo's bookstore. Kobo supports both EPUB and PDF files.



###PC software
A plethora of desktop applications exists that allow users to read EPUBS. Of the five applications mentioned above only Aldiko is not available on desktops and iBooks is a Mac-only application. Kobo and Kindle both offer Windows and Mac versions of their software, Linux support isn't available - although Kobo offered beta software for Debian based systems [^kobo-debian]. The functionality is similar to that of the mobile versions.

####[Calibre](id:calibre)
Calibre is an application of note here, because it's an ebook management suite with many features. It offers tools for managing large collections of ebooks, but also converts files to many different formats (both [ebook](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/03/28/converting-a-docx-directly-to-epub-using-calibre/) and other text based formats) [^calibre-file-formats]. Viewing all major ebook file formats, as well as editing EPUBs and AZWs is also part of the software package.



####Adobe Digital Editions
Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) is an ebook reader and management tool which is able to read EPUB and PDF. Support for EPUB3 is incomplete. Although Adobe claims support for all the important features is present, it doesn't elaborate on what those important features are. ADE also integrates with many ereaders offering syncing possibilities. So a library managed with ADE could in theory be synced with a compatible ereader.[^ade-readers]


###Web platforms
There are some web platforms for reading EPUBs online, their popularity is hard to gauge. A project called Bookworm, developed by Threepress, was closed by O'Reilly Labs in 2012 [^bookworm-oreilly]. The reason given for the closure mentions an 'interesting experiment' but also due to the dramatic changes in the ebook ecosystem over the past few years. Booki.sh, another project, is still online and offers a complete library of ebooks which may be view and stored online [^bookish]. It doesn't appear to operate commercially though, and the ability to purchase books was removed in June 2013 [^bookish-blog].

###Browser applications
Apart from web applications, several browser extensions exist allowing users to read EPUBs in their web browser. These extensions are most likely more of a convenience method in order to quickly (pre)view ebooks, instead of being fully-fledged solutions for reading ebooks comparable to the functionality of ereaders.


####Readium
Readium is a project by several publishers and technology companies aiming to provide a reference system, a collection of best practices, for rendering EPUB 3 publications [^readium-goals]. The Readium Project offers a range of tools for online and offline use, mainly geared towards software developers. One of the tools is a browser extension [^readium-extension] for the Google Chrome Browser. After installing the extension offers an EPUB reader inside the browser window.

####epubReader
epubReader is similar to the browser extension offered by Readium. However, the main difference is the supported browser, as epubReader is only compatible with Mozilla Firefox.


<!-- Amy: I noticed that 'Alternative ways of publishing' is repeated in chapter 09. I suggest to delete this, or at least to make a condensed summary. -->

###Alternative ways of publishing 

<!-- header title might change (app creators). this should be a chapter also covering layargloss and adobe digital publishing suites, sigil and calibre --> 
 
A single downloadable package like EPUB might be a great vehicle to monetize, but there could be other factors to consider when publishing. A consistent design and uniform interactivity across devices could be a requirement, in which case a reflowable document might not be the ideal solution. Some publishers opt to develop their own (mobile) applications, like The Guardian's iOS version of their newspaper, the amplified ebooks by Penguin or the children's book by Purple Carrot. [^guardian-ios] [^penguin-amplified] [^purple-carrot-publication] These solutions offer fine-grained control over user interaction and consistency of design, but come with the extra cost of hiring a development team to engineer the application. Also, publishing for different platforms is not that straightforward. Code written specifically with the iOS SDK (Software Development Kit) in mind will likely require a lot of editing before it's ready to run on the Android platform. Portability is another issue, it's fairly easy to transfer an ebook to another device. An application binary cannot be copied to another device that easily, partly because of incompatible platform architecture (iOS versus Android, or even iOS versus Mac OS X) and other, more artificial obstacles (DRM). 

<!-- Silvio: Adobe Digital Editions is the software used to read and manage e-books: http://www.adobe.com/it/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html
- the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite is a sort of extension of InDesign that allows to produce 'enhanced' magazines and publications for iPad, etc: http://www.adobe.com/it/products/digital-publishing-suite-enterprise.html -->


Lastly, why not just publish essays, articles or even whole books on a website? The wealth of weblogs and other publishing platforms shows that this is a viable form of publishing. Monetising is less straightforward, most websites generate income by showing advertisements or sponsored articles. Paid membership is also used as a business model by some websites, like *De Correspondent*.[^de-correspondent] One of the major downsides is that content will only be available online and cannot be easily passed around as a single unit of information like an EPUB or a PDF.

# 05 Distribution platforms

## Ebook stores: Amazon, Apple, Google, Kobo, Sony

Many channels exist for distributing ebooks. Curiously, most traditional retailers (large bookshops, like Libris or AKO in the Netherlands) play a marginal role in the selling of electronic publications, with the exception of a company like Barnes & Noble with their range of Nook devices and associated storefront. Large players in the field include Amazon, Apple, Google, Barnes & Noble and Kobo.

The aforementioned storefronts typically charge a percentage for each publication sold, this percentage generally is no less than 30% of the retail price. [^apple-press-percentage] [^guardian-amazon-hachette] Apart from Google, most of the larger retailers offer tight integration with their own branded ereader hardware (Kindle, iPad, Nook, etc.) For example, publications bought on a Kindle via the Amazon Store are immediately downloaded to the device for further use, without hooking the device up to a computer and transferring the purchases manually.

Each retailer accepts a different set of publications. Apple for example doesn't allow the sale of PDFs in its bookstore and only supports EPUB or publications made using iBooks Author. [^apple-publication-guidelines] Amazon, via their Kindle Direct Publishing programme, supports a wider range of publications formats, including AZW, EPUB, PDF and even Microsoft Word documents.

## Online reading platforms: Scribd, Issuu, Internet Archive, website / blog

Online reading platforms are browser-based platforms where digital publications are uploaded and made available. The publication can be presented in different formats. The choice for an online platform and the accompanying publication format also has effect on modes and reach of distribution.

When using an online reading platform, publishers effectively become dependent on the platform provider. If the platform changes its technology, terms of service or goes out of business, the publisher will be out of control. Online reading platforms typically create a higher degree of dependence and vendor-lock-in than classical ebookstores that distribute downloadable files (and where it is easier for a publisher to make those files on an alternative download/shop platform). 

Below several platforms are discussed, including characteristics, statistics, strengths and weaknesses, and how-to-publish.

###Social reading platforms

Social reading has to do with the experience of reading ebooks. It is a field in great development, which lies beyond the scope of this Toolkit. However, it is good for publishers working on epublications to keep an eye on the future of social reading.

Examples of social reading platforms: 
 
- *Goodreads* ('Goodreads is the world‚Äôs largest site for readers and book recommendations. Our mission is to help people find and share books they love. Goodreads launched in January 2007.')  
- *Social Book* ('Social Book, created by the Institute for the Future of the Book, is a social reading platform that allows reader to add their own commentary to texts, share these ideas with others, follow others‚Äô comments, and create communities of interactive reader/writers.') 
- *Wattpad* ('Wattpad stories are free. Whether you‚Äôre online or off, use the devices you already own to carry an entire library wherever you go.' 'Join the conversation about the stories you read: message the writer and interact with other people who love the story as much as you.')
- *Hebban* (A Dutch social reading platform that released in beta version in 2014)  
- *Social media discussions* are also part of the social reading experience. One can think here of Twitter interviews or when a book is being discussed online by a publisher.   


## Print-on-demand

There are a lot of options for print-on-demand publishing. A simple Google query will return a myriad of services. Below are discussed the most important ones, international and Dutch. Of course, 'regular' printers also offer print-on-demand services. However, they usually ask for a minimum of copies ordered.


###Lulu.com

*[Boekscout] (http://www.boekscout.nl/)* is one of the biggest print-on-demand publishers in The Netherlands, aimed at self-publishing. 



##Pirate platforms
As with music and films, 'pirate' platforms haven often been the avant-garde of electronic publishing. They provide music, films, games and electronic books as free downloads - either in outright copyright violation or in gray zones (when, for example, providing obscure and out-of-print books, films or recordings whose rights owners are unknown). Whether one likes it or not, pirate platforms have best met customer demand. Often, they are user friendlier than many Internet shops. The mere existence and popularity of pirate sites for digitized book shows, by the way, how large the market for electronic reading really is. Pirate platforms are, by their nature, even more volatile than online bookstores and ereading platforms. Worldwide, many organisations exist aiming to combat piracy and shut down facilitators of said practice, even when operating on a small scale. As a general rule pirate platforms have proven to be mostly resistent to the crackdown attempts by copyright enforcers, often reincarnating on a different web domain shortly after a forced closure.

Commercial providers of digital content can learn a lot from the pirates. [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com), the most successful web service for streaming films and growing competitor for pay tv, is known for buying films based on their popularity on [The Pirate Bay](http://thepiratebay.se). 

#### All-purpose download sites
Sites like [The Pirate Bay](http://www.thepiratebay.se) offer all kinds of media for download: films, music, computer games and software, and electronic books. Since they are widely used, display current download statistics and since their technology (bittorrent) depend on user participation for their downloads to stay alive, they can provide great insight into what is really popular among readers.

The content listed on The Pirate Bay and other sites for the bittorrent protocol tends to be mainstream: Hollywood films, pop music, and a tendency towards non-fiction and technical handbook literature alongside fantasy and Science Fiction among the ebook downloads. For example, on a particular day and minute in June 2014, the book 'Atlas of Ancient Worlds' had more than 2000 downloads in 48 hours. In comparison, the most popular film - an episode of the TV series 'Game of Thrones' - had more than 70000 downloads. 


#### General ebook sites

The most simple pirate ebook sites offer any kind of book - very much like a large all-audience book store or Amazon.com's online bookstores. They are little more than a simple search engine that spits out downloadable ebooks. These types of sites have become particularly popular in Russia. At the time of this writing, _library.ru_ has been the model for this kind of site and, after its crackdown, it was superseded by [bookfi.org](http://bookfi.org). Also [libgen.info](http://libgen.info), an online library, is an example to mention here. 

What online booksellers could learn from these sites: 
* Simplicity combined with encyclopedic scope. With no other site except Amazon's, it is as easy to find and download an electronic book, no matter which genre, language, whether bestselling or obscure.
* Simplicity in formats. The sites provide mostly PDFs as well as EPUBs, depending on whatever file format they have available (and obtained from hacker networks). 

#### Specialized sites

Some websites outside or in gray areas of copyright are artistic projects. In the 1990s, 'textz.com' by the Berlin-based artist Sebastian Luetgert was the first site to offer cultural, political and media theory books as simple, gratis-downloadable text files - among them, theory classics by Theodor W. Adorno. The name 'textz' was a pun on 'warez', a slang name for illegally copied software. Later, the web sites [aaaaarg.org] (http://aaaaarg.org/) and [Monoskop] (http://monoskop.org/Monoskop) provided related collections of freely downloadable art, cultural and media studies books, yet with different thematic emphases: to stimulate reading and discussion groups, or to provide a carefully hand-selected library mirroring the taste of the site owner. 

Best known, and factually legendary, is [Ubuweb](http://www.ubu.com), an encyclopedic site providing downloadable sound, video and text file version of avant-garde arts records, films and books. Most of them fall under the category of small edition artists' books, and are provided with the artists' permission - since most these works never created revenue when they were commercially released. 

All these sites run like small specialty bookstores (although they don't sell anything). They show that the opposite of Amazon and bookfi.org can work as well, namely the personal selection and combination of books. If they are as strong as in the case of Ubuweb and Monoskop, they create their own public that will download a work not because of having heard of it or of the author, but because being on such a particular site is recommendation enough. 




## artist-/designer-run e-publishing projects

In the last couple of years, there have been first attempts to create only
small presses and book download stores for [artists' and designer's books](04_genres_of_publication.html): writer, artist and publisher, James Bridle (who coined the term 'new aesthetics') created the website 'artistsebooks.org'  with freely downloadable EPUB files by experimental writers and artists. American contemporary artist and designer Paul Chan initiated the more commercial online press Badlands Unlimited that sells artist-made visual electronic books that are proprietary to the iPad and Apple's iBooks platform. The iPhone/iPad app 'KYR8' (slang riff on 'curate') invites artists' to quickly make their own electronic visual zines using page templates and user's cell phone photo collections. Other examples are [http://www.gauss-pdf.com] (http://www.gauss-pdf.com), a publisher of digital and print works and [http://trollthread.tumblr.com] (http://trollthread.tumblr.com), a collective of poets that produces publications available for download in PDF or purchase as print on demand volumes. 

None of these projects compete with classical ebook stores, online reading platforms or even specialist pirate sites. They are, after all, experimental projects and artists' portfolio pieces.

# 06 Towards a Hybrid Workflow Based on Markdown

Creating a workflow that is both structured and flexible enough to cater for the different choices made is a key step towards an efficient electronic or hybrid publishing strategy. The hybrid workflow we propose here is based on the need for publishing across different mediums, while keeping the majority of the work process in-house instead of outsourcing. 

First describing a more traditional workflow based on desktop publishing via InDesign with a print book as end result, we move to an ideally fitted workflow centered around the structural file format XML, ending with a Markdown-oriented workflow which is both easy to use and open to many possibilities. Following such a workflow will make the transition from a print-centered publication process to a digital and print - in other words: hybrid - publication process viable. 

Instead of producing a digital publication based on the printed book at the end of a production process, as is common practice by publishers, the workflow should be adjusted and made efficient and practical towards hybrid publishing at an earlier stage. From-scratch development of each publication format is thus replaced by single source multi-format publishing.

However, the description below starts at a point which in reality is not the beginning of the publishing trajectory, namely when an author hands in the definitive manuscript - so after the editing and rewriting process has passed through its final stages. Should the author already be working in Markdown, HTML or even XML format, this will change the workflow. However, in our experience manuscripts are mainly written in Microsoft Word and delivered in .doc or .docx.

Note: An important step preceding the publication trajectory lies in the formulation of the in-house style guide, where authors and editors can find the requirements for the manuscript. This style guide must be adapted according to the hybrid workflow before starting any work on the manuscript itself. For example: specification of the required file format, structuring of the text (headers, styles), image specifications, et cetera. See the Guide per genres <!--Miriam: internal link needed, comment copy edit (Amy)--> for pointers regarding adjusting the style guide in this sense.

We will now turn to implementing the new workflow for small edition and low budget publishing houses.

## Epublishing workflows: desktop publishing, XML, Markdown 
![Traditional Workflow](../images/_in_progress/07_workflowTRADITIONAL03.png "Workflow Traditional.")


![Traditional XML](../images/_in_progress/07_workflowMarkdown03.png "Workflow XML.")

<!-- links on the blog:

* http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/08/30/docx-to-markdown-using-calibre-and-pandoc/
-->

<!-- Silvio: This might be integrated with ICML import from pandoc to have structured text in InDesign to be used by the designer: http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/10/08/markdown-to-indesign-with-pandoc-via-icml/ -->

### Desktop publishing workflow (from Word to InDesign to digital)

Desktop publishing for a lot of publishers presents the current situation: a Microsoft Word file is imported into InDesign and, after designing and editing, exported to PDF, ready to be printed. The traditional, print-oriented workflow can be seen as standard for one-to-one publications: the print book is translated to an electronic version, following the 'original' as close as possible. 

There are certain advantages to this workflow: it is simple, linear, there are no version branches, you end up with one consolidated manuscript, and What You See Is What You Get when it comes to design. For example, in the case of a print design where the page is fixed, changing hyphenation is a laborious process as hyphen indications need to be inserted manually in the InDesign document. <!-- Miram: maybe this is not formulated very clearly, but there needs to be some explanation here --> However, in digital publishing, hyphenations are not fixed, but will be subject to change as they shift according to the aspect ratio and screen size of the device used. So when an editorial correction involves a hyphenation, this need not be adjusted in the digital file. However, this of course also means a limitation in electronic design possibilities. <!-- Marc: Where does 'this' refer to? Is automatic hyphenation in itself a limitation of design possibilities? -->

The main disadvantage of the DTP workflow is that you only target one medium and the steps to go from here to digital are cumbersome, and do not make full use of the potential in electronic publishing. A workflow with the paper publication as its basis generally tries to translate print into the digital books, keeping the workflow one-dimensional instead of multi-dimensional. 

Importantly, going from InDesign to an electronic publication is not ideal, especially when working with older versions of the software [![Bloglink](../images/_in_progress/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/05/21/epub-development-in-adobe-indesign-cs6/ "Link to blog post: NOTES ON EPUB DEVELOPMENT IN ADOBE INDESIGN CS6"). The results can be messy in terms of cleanliness of the code and may require extra steps in finalising the publication. InDesign, in its current state, is simply not optimised as a hybrid publishing tool, as it is (too) specifically developed for print design.[^1] The latest version of the InDesign suite (InDesign CC) is catered more to electronic publishing, but requires very careful structuring and preparation of documents in order to yield good results within manageable work times. It's best suited for projects where the content is generated from databases, imported as XML into InDesign and from there exported to EPUB. For a detailed look at these developments, see XXXXXXX Elisabeth Castro. <!--Margreet: chapter will be added by Liz Castro--> 

In the same way Microsoft Word (or any other text editor that uses a similar approach, for instance Open Office) is not well suited for processing structured text. When working with structured text the author is expected to wrap elements (a heading to emphasise words) in tags, word processors generally apply a visual style to a text, without bothering with tags or any other form of structure. To a certain extent these text processing programs allow working in a structured manner, by using stylesheets which determine for instance different types of headers. The problem is that they do not separate between formatting and structure, while in the world of digital publishing this is especially important.

It is possible to create 'interactive' publications in PDF, working with Microsoft Word and InDesign. In the end however these are also static InDesign documents, upgraded with some interactive layers. This is still a limited vision of what the possibilities are for digital publishing. The second workflow, which centers on the file format XML, does precisely that.

###From Microsoft Word (.docx) to EPUB

There is a viable solution for generating EPUB from Microsoft Word files, using the command line tool pandoc (see for more information the [pandoc website](http://www.johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ 'pandoc website')). The latest versions of pandoc (see below<!---insert cross-reference-->) support document conversion from '.doc' files generated by Microsoft Office 2007 or later, or by comparable programs like OpenOffice/LibreOffice. Since Word does not, as explained above, enforce good structure in a document, the EPUB generated by pandoc will never be perfect and ready for publishing. But it is still a clean enough, usable basis for a designer to produce a the final ebook. Other Word-to-EPUB programs, such as the built-in document converter of Calibre [![Bloglink](../images/_in_progress/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/03/28/converting-a-docx-directly-to-epub-using-calibre/ "Link to blog post: Converting a DOCX directly to EPUB using Calibre"), produce worse results. <!-- Marc: Needs a reference, I believe. -->

In order to obtain the best possible EPUB file, the Word document should be formatted, solely if possible, with Word's standard paragraph styles such as 'Normal', 'Title', 'Subtitle', 'Quote' and most importantly 'Heading 1', 'Heading 2',  'Heading 3'  for the headings according to their logical hierarchy. For example: 'Heading 1' for chapters, 'Heading 2' for sections, 'Heading 3' for subheadlines. The resulting EPUB document will contain a well-structured table of contents and document navigation menu based on the 'Heading' hierarchy, so well structured headings are of paramount importance. Word footnotes will be appear as linked endnotes in the EPUB, elegantly simplifying an otherwise tedious document redesign task.

Word unfortunately lacks two features that would make it more suitable for hybrid publishing projects:
1). Word does not have a 'strict mode' that would force all writers and editors of a document to only use defined paragraph styles instead of manually formatting. This means, your document will likely contain headlines that haven't been defined as headlines, but are just bold-faced text, quotes that haven't been defined as quotes etc. Unfortunately, if the manual formatting looks the same as the predefined paragraph styles, it is hard to impossible to spot these parts of a text.
2). Word provides no automatic or semi-automatic tools to find manual formatting and replace it with predefined paragraph styles. The only way to achieve this is to manually control and adjust the whole document. 

Often, such inconsistencies in a Word document will only become visible after the EPUB conversion, for example as a missing chapter headline in the table of contents of the electronic book. These are the inherent risks and limitations of using Word in the editorial workflow. Nevertheless, the Word + pandoc solution will likely be the easiest and least painful solution for publishers to adopt. <!-- Florian: We absolutely need to provide a dead-simple GUI or web tool for dropping a Word file to pandoc and obtaining EPUB + Markdown. @Michael and Marc, are you able to create this?-->

We recommend two ways of working with Word + pandoc, and discourage a third one:

1. Direct conversion from Word to EPUB using pandoc. This will require that the Word document is 100% consolidated and no further editorial changes will be applied to it. A graphic designer can take the converted EPUB document and quite painlessly transform it into the final electronic publication (among others, by changing the typographic design to make it suitable for ereaders, by scaling and optimising images for screen reading, by adding bibliographic metadata etc.). 
2. Conversion from Word to Markdown using pandoc. Since pandoc can also convert files _to_ the Markdown format, this often preferable, especially for complex publishing projects. The resulting Markdown file can then be used as the master file for conversions into all kinds of other file formats (such as HTML for websites). Converting to Markdown yields the advantage that any formatting glitch that existed in the Word document becomes clearly visible. For example, a headline erroneously formatted as bold standard text will show up as '\*\*headline\*\*' while a properly formatted headline will show up as '\#'. This makes it much easier to clean up the internal formatting of the document and have a clean master file for all subsequent document conversions. The EPUB file generated from this Markdown file would in most cases be better structured than the EPUB file directly generated from the Word file, and make the subsequent work of the designer easier. It is also possible to customise pandoc with conversion style templates. This even makes it possible to automatically generate complete and well-formatted EPUB files from the Markdown files without hiring a designer, depending on the type of publication. 
3. Not advisable: Using pandoc to go back and forth between Word and EPUB. If the Word document is not consolidated, but subject to further editorial changes, conversion to EPUB (like in the first scenario) would have to be done again, and destroy all work of the designer on the previously exported EPUB file. 
 

### XML 
<!-- Marc: This first paragraph is unclear. XML is not a 'document format' but it's a 'general document format'? Also the whole section appears to be a bit opinionated and lacking references, without providing references (messy XHTML?). -->
The most detailed structuring language developed is XML. It is often confusing for people to understand what XML is because it is not really a document format of its own, but a general document format with which other, specific document formats can be created. HTML (or XHTML), or example, is one XML-based document format, Microsoft Words' .docx is another.

XML is meant for structured documents that clearly separate logical structure from visual formatting, but it has two limitations; 1). since any document format can be constructed with it, messy formats like .docx and .xhtml can be constructed with it, too; 2). because it is itself a toolkit (or actually: a syntax) for defining document formats, it is very complex and quite difficult to work with. 

An XML document works like an archive: from this single document it is possible to create multiple output for different media. Thus, a misspelling or another error is changed in the XML document, which is then used to recreate the output to the different media. Formatting is done in a second step, with for instance **Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS). 

While XML theoretically presents the ideal way of working with single format files which deliver multiple output formats, we do not present it as the most advisable solution for small, independent publishing houses. Because XML is so detailed, with a very complex syntax and hard-to-use software tools, it is difficult to work with.

A good example how to practically use XML for electronic publishing in daily life is demonstrated in our chapter on using InDesign for hybrid paper and electronic publishing. <!--Miriam: this needs adding. Use example -->

### Markdown 

Central in a hybrid publishing workflow, we recommend to use the mark-up language Markdown, as it is an easlier language to use than XML. Markdown is not perfect, but is the most easy to work with and enables the creation of structured texts, thus allowing for hybrid publishing.

####Introduction: advantages and limitations
John Gruber, developer of Markdown, describes Markdown on his website as follows: 'Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).'^[2] Markdown is a way to process plain, unformatted text with human-readable formatting symbols. That means that Markdown doesn't use HTML style tags to format, such as `<b>` for bold or `<author>` to mark-up the author name. For example, this is what the beginning of *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* would like in Markdown:

    # Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
    
    ## Chapter I. Down the Rabbit-Hole

    There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
    it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,

    > Oh dear! Oh dear! 
    > I shall be late!

    (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she
    ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
    natural); but when the Rabbit actually **took a watch out of its
    waistcoat-pocket**, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice
    started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
    never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
    watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across
    the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
    down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

<!-- Margreet: Would it be possible to also present the result in a visual, like if one is using Mou or Macdown? -->

A short breakdown: '#' signifies a top-level headline, '##' a second-level headline, '_' italic text, ' ** ' bold text, '>' a block quote. Beyond that, Markdown provides conventions for marking up bold text, lists, embedded images and links. Its popular extension **MultiMarkdown** also supports footnotes, tables, mathematical formulas, cross-references, bibliographies and definition lists. With simple open source converter programs, Markdown text like the above can be automatically translated into well-structured HTML, EPUB, PDF, RTF (for importing into InDesign) and other document formats, with a single mouse click or keyboard command, requiring no manual adjustments. <!-- Margreet: Should be take about 'keyboard commands'? Is this clear for a publisher? -->

Markdown is a child of Internet culture. It standardises ad-hoc formatting signs used in e-mail and chats, and became popular in blogging software. There are similar plain text formatting languages to Markdown: the Wiki syntax used in Wikipedia, the language _Textile_ that is used for a number of web content management systems and the language _reStructuredText_ used for writing technical manuals, and many others. 

Markdown and its siblings are human-readable, human-friendly well-structured document formats, excellent for long-term storage and as the basis (or source code) for conversions into present and future document formats. While they are simple, they are also both strict and unambiguous enough in their formatting syntax that multiple writers and editors can work on a single document without introducing weirdness <!-- Amy: What do we mean by 'weirdness'? Can this be more specific? --> into its formatting. Another advantage of Markdown can be written and edited in any computer program capable of processing basic text. Unlike the file formats of Microsoft Word or other classical word processing programs, the file containing the Markdown flavoured text is not bound to specific software, it can be opened using the simplest applications able to parse text.

Why do we recommend Markdown in particular? For particular publishing projects - for example, handbooks or books derived from Wikis, it can be worth considering one the alternatives to Markdown such as _reStructuredText_. There are, however, two reasons why we recommend Markdown as a practical tool for electronic and mixed media publishing:

1. Excellent software support. As the most popular human-readable plain text formatting language, there is a plethora of user-friendly, high quality software for writing and editing documents in Markdown and for converting it into other formats available. While Markdown can be written and edited in any computer program that allows to edit text, there are a number of very user-friendly text programs that make it easier to write and view, think of Mou, Macdown, Texts, MarkdownPad, UberWriter or MdCharm.

2. With Multimarkdown (an extension of Markdown), it provides all the necessary formatting and document syntax needed in arts- and humanities-oriented text publishing. It is perfectly possible to write, for example, a cultural studies Ph.D. thesis in Multimarkdown, or the essay part (complete with footnotes and bibliographical references) of an exhibition catalog.

Markdown/MultiMarkdown is however not a magical one-size-fits-all solution. It is well suited for text-heavy editorial work, but limited when creating visual documents and not really usable for interactive publishing formats. It is also not a layout tool, but a pure manuscript format, excellent for keeping manuscripts in a well-structured, readable, durable, software-independent format. 

Markdown and similar formatting/markup language are meant for workflows in which there is a clear separation between editorial work - involving writers, translators and editors - on the one hand and publication design on the other. For publications requiring lots of interaction between writers/editors and visual designers/artists from the very beginning of the authoring process, these document languages are not the right tool. 


<!-- here. 12 sept.  who is this?  asks Miriam-->
<!-- But which ones should be used then? -->

<!-- Marc: XML again? This section is also highly opinionated and not referenced. Should this be merged with the previous XML section if possible? -->
#### Markdown versus XML

Markdown, and similar human-readable plain text markup languages could be called a 'poor man‚Äôs XML'. To summarise XML is complexity hell even by the measures of computer science. It is the holy grail of document processing, and has been deployed by large scale publishers (especially in the academic field) very successfully. For small to medium publishers, it is often overkill. Markdown provides a good middle-of-the-road solution of a format that is easily usable for non-technicians yet much better structured, and a basis for easy document conversion into HTML, EPUB and many other formats, than Microsoft Word and similar classical word processing programs.

Technically speaking, Markdown provides some of the same features and advantages, namely separation of content structure from visual layout, painless translation into multiple output formats. Their relative simplicity and human readability comes, however, at the price of extensibility and universality. XML is, strictly speaking, not a document markup language, but a meta-language (or toolkit) for building domain- and application-specific markup languages such as: a document markup language for exhibition catalogues, a document markup language for restaurant menus, a document markup language for flyers, etc.

Markdown & Co. do not provide this flexibility of building one‚Äôs own syntax, but provide only their built-in, hard-wired syntax. For example, if one needs syntax for encoding footnotes and endnotes, MultiMarkdown simply doesn‚Äôt provide it. One could think up and use one‚Äôs own syntax extension (for example ^^[1] for an endnote), but this would not be supported by the word processing and text conversion programs for Markdown. In XML, there are standard methods of declaring and extending markup languages that can automatically be picked up by XML document converters.

<!--Amy: Seems like there's a lot of repetition in this section: do these last two paragraphs need to be in? -->

However, the declaration of these extensions in the document syntax and conversion rules is highly complex. Even for computer scientists and engineers, XML is often so over-complex that they have resorted to simpler, human-readable language like Markdown, ReStructuredText and ASCIIdoc for software manuals.

They are not as universal and thoroughly structured as XML, but still provide the advantage of separating content structure from visual layout, along with the advantage of painless translation into multiple output formats. And lastly, XML has very complex markup that is hard to read and write for humans. Easy authoring tools for XML and any kind of XML-based document formats do not really exist yet.

#### Practical tips and tricks for working with Markdown 

##### Word Processing / editing programs

For Apple's Mac OS X and iOS, there are nice and very user friendly programs for editing in Markdown. <!--Margreet: What about Windows and Linux. Miriam: I added a Windows option, plus the open source Macdown. I think we should not name all these options but make a choice, for example only name the free ones? Otherwise, what is the criterium? -->

**Linux**
- [UberWriter](http://uberwriter.wolfvollprecht.de), this editor also includes built-in support for pandoc
- [MdCharm](http://www.mdcharm.com), supports MultiMarkdown

**Mac**
*Freeware:*
- [Mou](http://www.mouapp.com), with features like live preview, sync scroll, auto save, powerful actions, auto pair, custom themes and CSS, HTML and PDF export, enhanced CJK support and more.
- [Macdown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/), released under the MIT License and influenced in design and setup by Mou.

*Paid*
- [ByWord](http://bywordapp.com), a user-friendly, distraction-free text writing program with built-in MultiMarkdown support and export to HTML, RTF, PDF and Microsoft Word. The program runs on Macs, iPhone and iPad.
- [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/), a program similar to ByWord. The program runs on Macs, iPhone and iPad.
- [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php), a word processing program popular among professional writers, for Mac OS X and Windows. Fully supports MultiMarkdown internally

**Windows**
- [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/), free for personal use, with upgrade to MarkdownPad Pro to unlock additional features.


##### Document conversion programs
- [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/), the original program converts MultiMarkdown files into HTML, PDF, OpenDocument (for later conversion into RTF or Microsoft Word). Open Source, runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), similar in functionality to multimarkdown, but much more powerful. Pandoc reads more input formats (including HTML and reStructuredText) and can output HTML5, XHTML, LaTeX, RTF, Word, EPUB 2 and 3, PDF and many more. Typographic templates for the conversion can be easily customised. 

- [Calibre](http://http://calibre-ebook.com/), application suite that allows users to manage ebook collections as well as to create, edit, and read ebooks. It supports a variety of formats (including the common Amazon Kindle and EPUB formats), ebook syncing with a variety of ebook readers, and conversion (within DRM restrictions) from different ebook and non-ebook formats. Open Source, runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

Pandoc is the tool we recommend for working with Markdown, and has also been extensively used in creating this publication.

<!-- Marc: This is a very practical section all of a sudden. Maybe relocate it to another part of the toolkit? -->
##### Cleaning up Markdown

Since Markdown is a document format and not a word processing program, it does not offer functions like automatic renumbering of footnotes and list items during text editing. In fact, such numbers don't matter since everything will be renumbered during the document conversion anyway. 

However, to also make the Markdown text source coherent and tidy, pandoc can be used to clean it up. The trick is to tell pandoc to convert a document from Markdown to Markdown:

    pandoc -f markdown -t markdown --output markdown-document-clean.txt markdown-document.txt

##### A note on limitations

A major downside of Markdown is that it exists in several variants, each with their own extensions of the basic Markdown syntax. In the context of this Toolkit, we recommend the widespread variant 'MultiMarkdown' that includes syntax for footnotes, tables, citations, cross-references, image captions and document meta data. It is also fully supported by pandoc, the recommended software tool.

Another downside is that Markdown allows some formatting to be marked up in different alternative ways (for example, underlines or asterisks for italic text) which can introduce inconsistency in a collaboratively edited document. The trick mentioned above, to use pandoc for converting from Markdown to Markdown, can be used to eliminate such (visual) inconsistencies in a master document. 

At the time of this writing in late 2014, a controversial standardisation effort of Markdown and its extensions is underway, under the name 'CommonMark'. [^commonmark-controversy] We will update this Toolkit as soon as CommonMark has been standardised, released, and is supported by the software we recommend.


## Database publishing 
What is gained by a shift to a hybrid publishing workflow? First of all, producing a publication with the possibility to have multiple output formats will be more efficient. However, when the workflow is put into use without restraint and when you really 'change your life', great possibilities will open up. The most important option is shortly discussed here, namely database publishing which uses a so-called content management system.

The ideal database is a collection of independent, but mutually related, objects. These objects can be everything from structured text to pictures of wildlife. The issue at stake is that we need clear grammatical and categorization systems that go beyond the immediate use of the database. Take as an example your mailing list. We can take the full address including the name of the person as one object. But if we want to select per postal code or any other sub category in a full address or want to add more information to the persons name, such as age, email address and previous purchases, we have to make a strict scheme with so-called fields and sub-fields, including their interdependences (a house number demands a street name en visa versa), their indispensability (age might be not crucial), and so on.
What this means is that the holy grail of the all encompassing database is not only almost impossible but also an extremely time consuming operation to build and maintain. 

The best option is therefore to explicate the goals of the publication programmme as well as the practical limitations. The four genres we discuss in this booklet all have their own demands in relation to the creation and the dissemination of publications. An art catalog demands clear descriptors about the artist, the materials used, the sizes, the provenance, copyright, keywords according to established list, etc. Other collections of pictures might need only a subset.   

Also in pure text databases we have to be careful. On the one hand we have obviously the data related to the author's name, affiliation, address, etc. But it becomes a different discussion if pictorial illustrations, graphs, etc. are shared between look-alike publications and for that reason we want to identify these objects individually. If such is the case, we might consider a special sector in our database that pertains to illustrations and their specific descriptive sub-field only. The same holds true for bibliographic references and the collection of hyperlinks used in the text.

In conclusion, we can only advise that various objects or in other words pictorial or textual entities are provided with as many consistent metadata (field descriptors) as possible.

# 07 Guide: How to make a simple EPUB

## Direct conversion

![Simplest possible case](../images/_in_progress/08_markdown_to_epub.png "simple")
<!-- @Michael could you take this up with Loes and Kimmy? Margreet: where should this image go? What is it's purpose? There is also a small portion missing at the top-->


Making an EPUB doesn't have to be complicated. As the EPUB standard is open and based on HTML (the same format as web pages), there's a large and growing variety of ways to convert and export to EPUB from different kinds of sources. For very simple publications, it may be possible to use a tool that directly converts your document to  EPUB.

Two popular conversion programs that can convert from a wide variety of input formats and produce EPUBs are pandoc (see also chapter 6 <!-- internal link needed-->) and Calibre's conversion tool [ebook-convert](http://manual.calibre-ebook.com/cli/ebook-convert.html). 

For example, consider *Beowulf* available from Project Gutenberg in a variety of formats (including EPUB). The ['plain text' version](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16328), is the complete text of the book in a single file with no styling (no fonts, sizes, or bold etc). We can use this to show how a simple conversion to EPUB works.

### Calibre

![Simplest possible case](../images/_in_progress/07_1stepepub.png "simple")

[Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com) is an open source management and reading program for epublications. A more detailed description can be found in chapter 9 (<!--internal link needed-->). Calibre can also be used to convert files, for example into EPUB. How it works is shown below. Within a few simple steps Calibre allows you to make your own EPUB.

After downloading and installing the program, follow these steps:

Step 1: Open Calibre and import the original file you want to convert.
Step 2: Select the file and click 'Convert books'.
Step 3: Choose the file format for input and output.
step 4: Click OK; Calibre starts converting.
step 5: your EPUB is ready.


### Direct conversion to EPUB with pandoc

To make an EPUB of *Beowulf*, download the ['plain text' version](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16328) (the complete text of the book in a single file with no styling). In your Documents folder, make a sub folder named 'pandoc-test'. This is the folder where we‚Äôll store and retrieve documents to be converted and which are made by pandoc. Save the file in this folder with the name beowulf.txt. Download and install pandoc [pandoc installation page](http://www.johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html). Pandoc is working in the so-called command line mode and not in a user interface environment. Hence you can‚Äôt ‚Äòopen‚Äô the program and don‚Äôt see an icon. To convert the file into an EPUB follow the steps below.

* First open the file with Microsoft Word or a similar program. Save the file as a docx-document, in the same folder called 'pandoc-test'.

* Pandoc is a command-line tool. There is no graphic user interface. So to use it, you‚Äôll need to open a terminal window: 

Windows: To start pandoc type cmd in the RUN (also called ‚Äòsearch programs and files‚Äô in the start panel which can be found under the MS window icon down in the toolbar), this will enable you to start the command mode. You'll get a white/black window saying C:\\user\\yourusername\>. There you type pandoc (enter) and the same line reappears, waiting for pandoc input (see further below).<!-- Double \ used to espace meta value of \ in Mardown and display C:\\ literaly  -->

Mac: To use pandoc open the Terminal from your Utilities folder in your Applications folder, or through the search bar in the top right of your screen. Pandoc will be used to convert files in the steps below. Note: Pandoc does not work on older Mac operating systems.

* Go to the Terminal and type cd Documents. This means the Terminal will ‚Äòchange directory‚Äô to the Documents folder.
* Now type cd pandoc-test. The Terminal will change directory to the folder within the Documents folder called pandoc-test. Now you can work with the documents in there.
* On Mac, type ls [l as in lima, referring to ‚Äòlist‚Äô], on Windows dir to get a list of files in the current folder. The beowulf.docx should be listed.
* To convert the file from docx to EPUB, type the following into the terminal: 

		pandoc beowulf.docx -f docx -t epub -s -o beowulf.epub
		
* The filename beowulf.docx tells pandoc which file to convert, -f docx -t epub, so from docx to EPUB. The -s option says to create a ‚Äòstandalone‚Äô file, with a header and footer, not just a fragment. And the -o beowulf.epub says to put the output in a file named beowulf.epub. (Note: in Mac you can copy-paste the command, in Windows you can‚Äôt copy-paste.)
* Check that the file was created by typing ls or dir again. You should see beowulf.epub.
* Open the EPUB from the folder or  in the Terminal type 

 	 	open beowulf.epub 
 	
* Note that you can also start from Markdown. Then open the text file in your Markdown editor and save as a markdown file. Type the following command in pandoc to convert into EPUB:


		pandoc beowulf.md -f markdown -t epub -s -o beowulf.epub


##Do it yourself EPUB from scratch

The process of creating an EPUB from scratch is similar to developing a simple website. The main difference is that while websites can and often link to other websites, an EPUB is 'self-contained', any pages that are linked to, or images that are displayed must be part of the collection. Creating an EPUB by hand is useful for creating small personal publications, or for making publications that explore the particularities of the EPUB format in detail.

An EPUB is a zip archive typically named with the extension '.epub' instead of '.zip'. The EPUB is a compressed collection of HTML files, stylesheets, and images, like the files found on a website, compiled together with some extra files that mark and structure the files so that an ereader can display them. Any file archiver that works with zip files (Archive Utility, The Unarchiver, WinZip, etc.) can open and decompress an EPUB. In some cases, it might simply be done by renaming the '.epub' with '.zip'. More information about how to automate the EPUB zipping process can be found [here](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=55681). 

A rudimentary EPUB is used as an example to explain several of its concepts and may be [downloaded here](https://github.com/DigitalPublishingToolkit/Hybrid-Publishing-Toolkit-for-the-Arts/raw/master/examples/Example.epub).

###Layout of an EPUB package

Decompressing an EPUB will reveal its directory layout and in that way makes clear how an EPUB is set up. As explained above, the EPUB can be seen as a compressed zip archive. First unzip it using an archive program. After unzipping it, it looks as follows:

![Figure: EPUB layout](../images/_in_progress/08_EPUB-layout.png "Figure: EPUB layout")
<!--@Kimmy Margreet: Can the image be cleaned, i.e take out shared media and also raptor, etc. Miriam: and zoom in on the filenames, can't read it like this. Kimmy: image is still in progress-->

The *META-INF* and *OEBPS* directories and *mimetype* should always be present in an EPUB file and form a large part of what constitutes an EPUB: 

* *META-INF* contains an XML file (*container.xml*) which directs ereaders to an inventory (an .opf file) of all the files present in the publication.

* *OEBPS* is the location where all the content (HTML files, images, audio, video, etc.) of the publication is stored; (nested) subcategories are possible but not mandatory. The .opf file (traditionally named *content.opf*) is important; this contains the metadata for the EPUB and is in turn referenced by the aforementioned *container.xml*. You might see another file with a .ncx extension (traditionally *toc.ncx*), it holds the hierarchical table of contents for the EPUB and is entirely optional as it isn't part of the EPUB specification.

* *Mimetype* is a file that contains a single line describing the EPUB file as `application/epub+zip`, this file allows ereaders to check whether the file is actually an EPUB and thus if they can read it.

These three components form the basic structure of an EPUB and are required in order for the file to be a valid EPUB. For a formal specification of EPUB3, see the overview by [IDPF.org](http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html) which defines semantics and conformance requirements for EPUB publications.

###Creating your own EPUB

Most of the elements of an EPUB can be produced by hand in a text editor. Text editors is used for editing plain text files (for example HTML files) and should not to be confused with word processors like Microsoft Word or Apple's Pages. Popular text editors include BBEdit, TextWrangler or TextMate for Mac or NotePad++ and PSPad for Windows. Below follows a step by step process of creating a very simple EPUB.


####Creating the required files and directories

Now that we've seen the insides of an EPUB after unzipping it, we can work the other way around and make the files and folders ourselves, thus creating a simple EPUB. We will work from our Documents directory where we can add folders like in the image above, and using a text editor to create the necessary files.

<!--Margreet: Underneath steps go to fast to my opinion. Files and directories?! It would help to write a small introduction here maybe?
Miriam: is it clearer now?-->
1. Create a directory under Documents to store the files and subdirectories for your EPUB, and name it *Example*;
2. Create two more directories inside the one you've just created, one called *META-INF* and the other *OEBPS*;
3. Using a text editor create a plain text file and add the line `application/epub+zip` to the file;
4. Save the plain text file, without a file extension, and name it *mimetype*. Put it alongside the two directories you created in step 2. In this way ereaders can see that this is an EPUB.

Now there are the two directories and one text file, like we saw when we decompressed the EPUB used as an example.


####container.xml

Next we make the file 'container.xml', the XML file that directs ereaders to an inventory of all the files present in the publication, and that is located in *META-INF*. 

1. Again using a text editor, create a new file and save it to the *META-INF* directory with the name *container.xml*;
2. The *container.xml* contains a simple structure written in XML. Below is a complete version of the text, followed by an explanation of its separate parts. (You may ignore the explanation without much consequence if its too technical in nature.) 

	```
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
	<container version="1.0" xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:container"> 
		<rootfiles>
			<rootfile full-path="OEBPS/content.opf" media-type="application/oebps-package+xml"/>
		</rootfiles>
	</container>
	```
	
The first line is a `declaration statement` which should always be present in XML files. This is followed by the `container` which denotes that the publication is based on the *Open Container Format* as specified by the EPUB standard[^epub-standard]. The `rootfiles` tag denotes a collection of rootfiles, which is the possible starting point(s) for ereaders to begin processing and parsing the content. In this case the rootfiles contains only one entry, called `rootfile`, this tag has two attributes - `full-path` and `media-type`. The first attribute holds the path to an inventory file (in this case *content.opf*) containing metadata regarding the publication and its content. Finally, `media-type` is a reaffirmation of the EPUB's mimetype.
	
The important part of this document is the information in quotes following the attribute `full-path`: 'OEBPS/content.opf'. This attribute should point to an .opf file created in the next step.  

3. Save and close *container.xml*.  


####The OPF file

The OPF file is an important part of the structure of an EPUB. It is located in the OEBPS directory and contains the necessary metadata to accurately describe the publication. Next to that it can contain the linear reading order which, in combination with the contents of toc.ncx, may be used by ereaders to build navigation menus or a table of contents. The OPF file is too long to be included verbatim in this document, but the most important sections are referenced below. The file 'Example.opf' in the rudimentary EPUB used here, is an example of a complete opf file.

```
	<metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
		xmlns:opf="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
		<dc:title>Example EPUB</dc:title>
		<dc:language>en</dc:language>
		<dc:identifier id="BookId">http://digitalpublishingtoolkit.org/ExampleEPUB.html</dc:identifier>
    	<meta property="dcterms:modified">2014-03-28T14:11:50Z</meta>
    	...
	</metadata>
```

The metadata section describes the current publication. It lists information such as the title, author, publisher, etc. Most of these entries are identical to what librarians use to catalogue publications. Parts of the metadata section are used by ereaders to organize collections.
	
```	
  <manifest>
    <item href="styles.css" id="css1" media-type="text/css"/>
    <item href="cover.png" id="cover" media-type="image/png" properties="cover-image"/>
	<item id="chapter1" href="Cover.html" media-type="application/xhtml+xml" />
	<item id="chapter2" href="Page-01.html" media-type="application/xhtml+xml" />
	<item properties="nav" id="toc" href="toc.html" media-type="application/xhtml+xml" />
    <item href="toc.ncx" id="ncx" media-type="application/x-dtbncx+xml"/>
  </manifest>
```

A manifest lists all the resources available in the EPUB package, with the exception of directories, the *mimetype* file, the contents of *META-INF* and the .opf file itself. A manifest file can be a pain to produce by hand for large EPUBs, as the list of resources utilised in the publication is bound to be long. Every resource has a unique `id` and should be referenced by a relative path in the `href` tag and described in the `media-type` attribute. The entry with the *cover.png* is of special interest, as the attribute `properties` describes the fact that the image may be used by ereaders as the cover image for the publication - e.g. for use in collection overviews.

```
  <spine toc="ncx">
  	<itemref idref="chapter1" />
  	<itemref idref="chapter2" />
  </spine>
```
Lastly, the `spine` lists all the pages present in the publication and it's listing arrangement tells an ereader the linear reading order of the publication. The `spine` can only contain (X)HTML pages, not images or other content. The `toc` attribute refers to the `id`  of the `toc.ncx` in the manifest.
	

####The content

As stated in the introduction of this section a large part of an EPUB is a collection of HTML files which are often interlinked. The process of creating the pages of an EPUB is similar to building a website, but with the particular limitations of ereaders in mind - limited support for rich media, colour, etc. An overview of the limitations can [be found here](<!--link missing-->). Pages should be written in XHTML, a variant of HTML which was created to make HTML more extensible and increase the interoperability with other data formats. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) may freely be used, though a lot of ereaders ignore or do not parse many of the style definitions.


####Packaging

Creating an EPUB file is as simple as selecting both the *META-INF* and *OEBPS* directories and the *mimetype* file and creating a ZIP archive. This may be done by using the built-in archive utility of the operating system, or an external program like The Unarchiver (Mac) or WinZip (Windows) or a special purpose utility.[^epub-zip-unzip] The .zip extension of the archive may then be renamed to .epub. 

Because some archive programs create unnecessary (hidden) files inside the archive which might invalidate your EPUB, it's important to validate your EPUB to see if it works (although most ereaders will safely ignore extraneous files and parse the document properly). Invalid EPUBs are files that do not conform to the EPUB specification or have other issues, such as incorrect. Fixing validation errors will minimize but not eliminate the chance of ereaders refusing to read an EPUB. Validation of the EPUB can be done online using the [EPUB Validator](http://validator.idpf.org) or [a desktop application](http://www.pagina-online.de/produkte/epub-checker/).

Now your EPUB is ready! It can be opened and enjoyed in an ereader like Calibre, iBooks or a similar application.

# 08 Guide: E-publications per genre

## General questions
<!--Visual by Arjen--> <!-- This is already added to chapter 5. What is the purpose of that visual in this chapter? what should it depict? (kimmy asked this question)-->

## Research publication

### General
Traditional, print oriented workflow for text-centred works, with additional illustrations / videos / resources online, and extended referencing and/or indexing  
See Kimmy's visualized workflow for the INC, which will be generalized for [research-type publications](researchlikepub.html)

* Editor works with author(s) on manuscript  
* Several versions going back and forth between different people in different roles (editor, author, copyeditor, designer)  
* Final version of the text will be in a text editor or Microsoft Word format  
* This is then designed in InDesign  
* Corrections made to the print proof and added in the InDesign file  
* Certified PDF goes to printer  
* How to make an electronic publication from InDesign - this is the big problem. Going from InDesign to electronic publication is not easy and needs a lot of manual work

*New workflow*  
This is why the new workflow is directed towards **hybrid input** and **hybrid output** - which leads to a **workflow that is also hybrid**, but centered around **a single 'archive format'** - the definitive version that enables multiple output. 

So instead of having a final text file (e.g. Word) which is changed in InDesign - both of which are not good formats to convert to an EPUB ‚Äì the storage / archive file has to be in a format that can translate into InDesign for the print edition and EPUB / mobi / web for the e-publication. The most suitable format for this is **html** - because it allows footnotes (which Markdown does not). The html can easily be converted to EPUB, though not so easily to InDesign... (working on this) <!-- Also check http://digitalpublishingtoolkit.org/2014/05/import-html-into-indesign-via-xml/ --> <!-- Kimmy: I thought we are promoting markdown as archival file and not html? markdown to indesign is very straightforward using pandoc -->

Flow chart: workflow -
![Hybrid Workflow Research Publication](../images/_in_progress/08_WorkflowResearchPub.png "Workflow Hybrid") <!-- very rough sketch -->


### Decision making

**Should it be a 1:1 transfer from paper book to ebook?**  
This is the traditional view.  
The book is a unique, one off publication.  
A lot of different people working on separate parts of the project, but all towards one single goal: the end product, mostly print, sometimes translated 1:1 to an ebook.

With text oriented files this may seem the most straightforward, maybe even the only useful way. There is not more than text, perhaps accompanied by a couple of images. Most important is e.g. to get references right, and a nice advantage is that making an index will be much easier digitally.

**What are alternative possibilities?**  
What is possible when using a hybrid workflow, focused as much on e-publications as on print? (Next to having digital publications running naturally from the workflow, instead of having to be forced out of the print oriented workflow, of course)  

* Version control can be more transparant   
* Adding elements other than text (videos, (color) images, links)  
* Extracting outputs from the material different from the book itself, such as abstract, booktrailers, personalized e-publications  
* Better archiving as one can keep the structure of the text as well
* ...

### Instructions

**How to adjust the style guide?**  
The decision about the desired output leads to certain steps to get the right input. First of all it is therefore necessary to communicate this to the authors and others involved in the publishing process. Adjust your style guide which is leading in the communication with authors/designers/programmers etc.

Specify for example:  

* file format - for example, if you are following the proposed workflow, request the file to be sent in either html directly (which can be converted into EPUB) or docx (which can be easily converted into html)  
* image style and format - while the print book has b/w pictures, <!-- Amy: I don't quite understand this point. a printed research  publication can also have color images --> the ebook enables color images; print requires large quality 300 dpi .tiff images, while these may be too heavy for an electronic publication, skyrocketing the size of the book, which is bad for download / and or storage space on an ereader.
* formatting styles - use Header 1 style for title and author, Header 2 for article sections and Header 3 for subsections <!-- The structuring in programs like Microsoft Word might need a bit more explanation? or at least a link to a website which clearly explains how to work with this ^kimmy --> 
* URL style - full URLs should be clickable but not stylized as links (color or underlining)  
* What kind of metadata does the author have to provide - e.g. keywords, contact information, abstract, biography     
* an extended example of a style guide adjusted for a hybrid workflow can be found in the appendix <!-- Is this possible and desirable? ^Miriam -->

**What metadata to add?** <!-- shouldn't we explain why you need to add this metadata? Or is this explained elsewhere? if so add a link to that. -->
Make a list of metadata to be added to the texts  

* metadata provided by the author(s)  
* metadata added by the editor/publisher
* an extended example of a metadata list adjusted for a hybrid workflow can be found in the appendix <!-- Is this possible and desirable? ^Miriam -->

**Do editorial criteria regarding the content change?**  
Editorial criteria for the content can also differ in a hybrid workflow and depending on the desired output and the answer to the question of the relationship between the print and electronic edition:  

* (not discussed in this guide) consider another style of writing, 'writing for the web'   
* is interactive material needed, more or other images than can be published in print, video, audio, etc.

## Art/design catalogue
Catalogue Digital Approaches
![Catalogue Approach](../images/_in_progress/08_WorkflowCatalogus.png "Catalogue Digital Approaches") <!-- very rough sketch -->


<!--4000 words-->

### General
traditional workflow = InDesign workflow as described before, production of one integral publication

vs. new workflow = highly modularized publication. 

### Decision making
Should it be a 1:1 transfer from paper book to ebook?, What are alternative possibilities?

In most cases, today, an art catalogue is difficult to translate 1:1 to an electronic publication, simply because of file sizes. It's advisable to split it up into smaller publications, such as monographic micro-ebooks on single art works, or collections of articles that each reader can individually choose and obtain as an automatically customized e-book.

### Instructions
1:1 translation into electronic publication: target one reading medium (in most cases: tablets). Strongly consider PDF over EPUB if the focus is on images, and image composition requires a fixed layout. Target a 10" tablet screen with a resolution between 1024x768 and 1920x1080. Work in InDesign, and make - if necessary - a customized new page layout that fits these dimensions. Consider small additions of interactive and multimedia elements by using Adobe Acrobat Pro as a final authoring tool. (This is part of the Adobe Creative Suite). Consider this project a short- to medium-term project that might have become technically obsolete/outmoded in 3-5 years.

Custom translation into modularized publications: EPUB is the file format of choice because it is internally modular (being nothing more than a zip archive of individual HTML files, images, fonts etc). Have a web developer program a simple custom server application that can customize, zip and upload an EPUB file according to a user's web form input. Also consider generating this EPUB from a database/content management system (see previous chapter xxx).

### Specific issues for this publication type
Above all: file size because of number and resolution of included images.
Solutions: 

- Modularize content (by in-app download, see Stedelijk project)

- Create separate low-res and hi-res versions; can also be used as a business model (gratis or cheap low-res book, pay for hi-res book). Explain how on-the-fly resolution adjustment is easy with epub (using server-side scripting for resizing images and zipping the epub file), not so easy with PDF.

- Question/issue: Is a catalogue in the traditional definition a desirable publication format for e-publishing, or do we (a) have to think up new forms of small/smart catalogues, or (b) wait for more device storage capacity and network speed to arrive in the future? At the moment, producing a 100+ pages hi-resolution catalogue electronically does not make sense, except as heavy PDF files for desktop computer viewing.

### Based on the above, what to choose?

How to make an art/design catalogue in EPUB2/3, HTML5 (/app), PDF

### General
traditional vs new workflow

Traditional workflow: book as conceptual design object or even sculptural object

New workflows:

- make a book simply as a series of page-size images, can be easily converted into screen-readable PDF, EPUB and HTML5

- Look at visual tools like Calibre and The People's Ebook, or authoring/sharing apps such as KYUR8

- Use Liz Castro's recipe for turning an artists'/designer's tumblr into downloadable artists' ebooks

- media artist approach: experiment with computer/server-generated epub, using collage/cut-up methods, generative or appropriation art recipe (similar to the Yes Men's "Ream Weaver" web site mirroring tool)

- pirate site approach: quick & dirty conversions of publications into ebooks, emphasis on spreading, and alternative ways of networking (such as person-to-person USB stick file exchange, as described in Henry Warwick, Radical Tactics of the Offline Library)

- since the artists' book is not a defined genre, any methodology / workflow that can be thought of

How to make an arts/design periodical in EPUB2/3, HTML5 (/app), PDF

A step-by-step guide

Advantages, disadvantages

<!--Florian's text:-->

Lately, artists' and designer's books have grown from a niche phenomenon to a major genre within arts and design publishing. It could be argued that the book as an art or design object in its own right has become more prominent now that the function of the book as a generic carrier of information (such as in a telephone directory, a dictionary or a run-of-the-mill novel or non-fiction paperback) is increasingly taken over by the World Wide Web and by ereaders. 

The history of artists' books - or 'bookworks', as the Mexican-Dutch writer and visual artist Ulises Carri√≥n called them[^1] - is often traced to the beginnings of concrete poetry, Fluxus and conceptual art, and the artists' books (and book-like objects) made among others by Dieter Roth and Ed Ruscha. But one could just as well include the Bauhaus book series ('Bauhausb√ºcher') of the 1920s, earlier Dadaist and Futurist pamphlets and self-published books, the books made in the 19th century Arts and Crafts movement and even 16th century illustrated books like Sebastian Brant's and Albrecht D√ºrer's 'Ship of Fools' that were crafted in workshop collaborations between writers, visual artists and printmakers.

The common denominator of these books is that they defy easy categorization and genre characteristics, making it difficult to give standard recommendations for their design as electronic books. 

#### Transfer from paper to electronic?

The more medium-specific an artist's book is, the less sense it makes to translate it 1:1 into an electronic book. Dieter Roth's sculptural book objects, for example, would change from book art works to mere depictions of book art works when reproduced electronically. 

On the other hand, many contemporary artists, designers and media activists experimented with electronic publishing as a 'poor' (i.e. simple low tech) medium of social sharing rather than a 'rich' visual and tactile medium:

* In the 1980s and early 1990s, many makers of zines (do-it-yourself small press periodicals) became makers of _e-zines_, electronic zines that used dial-up computer bulletin boards and the Internet as noncommercial samizdat media. [Their typical publication] (http://www.textfiles.com/directory.html) format were simple plain text files. Many e-zines worked around their technical limitations by using ASCII art, typograms as they had also been produced in 1960s and 70s concrete poetry on typewriters, and with homebrew formatting codes ('_' for underlines, '#' for headlines etc.), the immediate precursors of the Markdown format described here in this toolkit.
* In the early 1990s, there also existed a hacker culture of 'disk mags' for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST home computers. These electronic magazines were anonymously published on floppy disks and were based on self-written computer programs (factually, early 'apps') that displayed their animated text and visual contents.
* Since the late 1990s, there have been a number of artist-run sites * textz.com, ubu.com, aaaaarg.org, monoskop.org - that offer free downloads of cultural theory and arts-related books, typically in simple formats such as plain text, PDF and EPUB.
In these examples, the focus is not on the book as a visual object, but on concepts and politics of its sharing and dissemination; in other words, artists' publishing as electronic samizdat. In such scenarios, artists' publishing as simple 1:1 transfers from print originals to electronic reproductions can make sense.

##### Technical solutions for samizdat publications

For such activist or minimalist projects, the lowest technical denominator and most easily readable file formats are advisable:

* plain text (ASCII) as the most simple, compatible and minimalist solution
* single-file HTML. It is possible to directly embed images into an HTML file (without providing them as separate files); technical instructions can be found [here](...).
* PDF. This format is widely readable and best suited for faithfully reproducing print books, but limited in its readability on different devices and hardly editable (more explanation [here](...)).
* EPUB. This format is factually just HTML for offline reading, with improved publication meta data and improved compatibility to ereaders. Projects can very easily be made and provided both in HTML and EPUB.
Since the design of most samizdat books does not differ from that of [research publications](...) or other visually simple publishing formats, no special design advice is necessary here, except the principle of 'worse is better': the smaller the file size, the most compatible and universally readable the file format, the better, even if this comes at the expense of typographic and visual quality. An plain text files, then, might be preferable to a nicely designed PDF file. <!-- Silvio suggests also to focus on the technical solution for  sharing texts, like etherpad, textb.org -->

#### How to make visually oriented artists' books

##### Pre-history and general issues

There is, factually, a rich tradition of artists' audiovisual electronic books: It began in the 1990s with hypertext and interactive multimedia literary experiments on floppy disk, CD-ROMs, later web sites and mobile apps. The [Electronic Literature Organization](http://eliterature.org) and the international research project [ELMCIP](http://elmcip.net/knowledgebase) document it extensively. Much of this documentation has become media archeology since multimedia formats have become obsolete: CD-ROM applications that no longer run on contemporary computers, websites whose links or plug-ins are no longer working or not compatible to today's browsers anymore. 

This problem was greater in the 1990s and early 2000s when working open, cross-platform multimedia standards barely existed. But even today, the rule explained in chapter ... <!-- cross-reference to Arjen's overview graph of non-visual vs. visual epublishing technologies--> still applies: The more complex the audiovisuality of an electronic book, the less compatible it will be to all kinds of different electronic reading devices, and the more technical updates it will likely need over the course of time. <!-- Silvio: This problem was also exemplified by the massive use of Flash by e-lit artists --> 

##### Simple solutions

Electronic visual books can be made in very simple ways:

* As a sequence of images, embedded into an EPUB file <!-- add reference-->, a self-contained HTML file <!-- add reference--> or a PDF file.
* As a PDF file. PDF generally is the most easy-to-use straightforward format for visual publications in a universally working format.[^2] PDF documents can be graphically designed to work on different screen sizes, and resolution of embedded visuals can be decreased to keep the file size friendly for downloading. Still, the format is essentially limited to fixed document sizes and remains an electronic representation of printed matter. 
* Other standard file formats creatively (ab)used as document formats for visual books: animated GIF graphics files for the digital equivalent of flip books, for example, mp4 video files displaying a real-time book, mp3 audio files triggering abstract art on the volume meter display of an audio player, JPEG files with encoding artefacts of corrupted bits.[^3] <!-- should this be mentioned as simple? not all of these formats work on e-readers. mention reference to image of Arjen or overview of strengths and weaknesses -->
* Self-contained HTML. <!-- explain the use of self-contained HTML with base64-->

## Art/design periodical

- Art OPEN Magazine of e-Flux journal, advise to use the web, instead of EPUB. 

- Non-commericial website / PDF 

- Academic magazine (jStor) 

- Public Magazine 

- Commercial / app store model. <!--1000 words -->

### General
![Periodical Approach](../images/_in_progress/08_WorkflowPeriodical.png "Periodical Digital Approaches") <!-- very rough sketch -->

(a) magazine as downloadable PDF file; 

(b) magazine as PDF-based app in a tablet, via commercial app platform (such as Scribd or issu) or PDF-to-app software. Low-cost solution with a traditional revenue model (in-app purchase). Commercial authoring solution: Woodwing.

(c) magazine as HTML5-based publication in a platform app. Commercial distribution platform solution: Blendle.

(d) magazine as self-published website. Best solution: CMS like WordPress, with custom design template. Most independent magazines work this way, but revenue model is difficult. Additional technical benefit: structured database of everything ever published on the site, easy to use as a basis for exporting to custom publications (downloadable e-books, InDesign layout for print yearbooks - see Elizabeth Castro's chapter - etc.)


### Decision making
Should it be a 1:1 transfer from paper book to e-journal?  There are now gradual transitions from traditional to new workflows in digital magazine publishing which break up the old-vs-new dichotomy. On this scale, providing a magazine as a downloadable PDF file is the most traditional solution, and turning the magazine into a website (running on a content management systems such as WordPress) the least traditional. On the upside, all these technical solutions are now mature thanks to 20 years of online news publishing.

### Instructions
See above. 

### Specific issues for this publication type
The main issue is to which extent the integrity of the publication as _one_ medium is important, or whether to entirely give up the traditional system of periodical appearance in bundled issues. Alternatively, the model could be (a) a continuously updated web site (similar to a news website or a blog), (b) focus on providing single articles rather than bundled issues based on search engine hits, social media recommendations etc. In the end, there is no hard difference between a "blog" and a "magazine" online.

### Based on the above, what to choose?

How to make an arts/design periodical in epub2/3, HTML5 (/app), PDF

A step-by-step guide

Advantages, disadvantages:

- epub2/3 is, at the moment, an esoteric choice for a magazine and would be rather an option for scholarly journals. However, if cleverly used, it can combine advantages of PDF (single file distribution) with HTML (responsive design, small file sizes, modularity/reusability, automation).
- HTML5: theoretically ideal, gets increasingly used for multimedia journalism (following the example of the "Snow Fall" reportage by the New York Times from December 2012. Problem of design complexity when making 'responsive' design pages.
- PDF: easiest to integrate in existing workflows, disadvantage: clumsy, non-responsive, high file size, meant for print.


# 09 Guide: Alternative ways of publishing
<!-- This is a draft chapter and should be extended with a guide on how to create an EPUB using Adobe InDesign CC 


Miriam: in chapter 7 there is also a small section on Calibre (how to make a simple ebook) - what is the difference with this chapter?-->

A single downloadable package like EPUB might be a great vehicle to monetise, but there could be other factors to consider when publishing. A consistent design and uniform interactivity across devices could be a requirement, in which case a reflowable document might not be the ideal solution. Some publishers opt to develop their own (mobile) applications, like The Guardian's iOS version of their newspaper, the amplified ebooks by Penguin or the children's book by Purple Carrot. [^guardian-ios] [^penguin-amplified] [^purple-carrot-publication] These solutions offer fine-grained control over user interaction and consistency of design, but come with the extra cost of hiring a development team to engineer the application. Also, publishing for different platforms is not that straightforward. Code written specifically with the iOS SDK (Software Development Kit) in mind will likely require a lot of editing before it's ready to run on the Android platform. Portability is another issue, it's fairly easy to transfer an EPUB to another device, however application binaries are not that easily passed around, mostly due to the relatively closed nature of mobile operating systems.

Lastly, why not just publish essays, articles or even whole books on a website? The wealth of weblogs and other publishing platforms shows that this is a viable form of publishing. Monetising is less straightforward, most websites generate income by showing advertisements or sponsored articles. Paid membership is also used as a business model by some websites, like *De Correspondent*. One of the major downsides is that content will only be available online and cannot be easily passed around as a single unit of information like an EPUB or a PDF.


##Authoring Suites
A range of publishing suites is available as well, which roughly fall into two categories. One can be described as full-blown editors, the other allows publishers to enhance existing publications with interactive features.

###Editors: Calibre
<!-- Miriam: why is Calibre called an editor here?-->
[Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com) is a 'swiss army knife' for reading, converting, authoring and cataloging e-books. It is open source, runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (with identical graphical interfaces on all these platforms) and is under very active development with frequent version updates. We recommend it as a standard tool for all ebook publishers next to pandoc and consider it superior to (older) alternatives like [Sigil](http://code.google.com/p/sigil). The inexpensive commercial program [Jutoh](http://www.jutoh.com), which also runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, is superior as an easy-to-use graphical editor for ebooks since it gives writers and editors a user interface similar to that of Microsoft Word. Jutoh is less powerful as a document converter and ebook database.

Calibre can be used to:

* open and read EPUB files on a personal computer;

* import various documents in various ebook and electronic text formats (including .docx, rtf, HTML and plain text) and convert them into EPUB; export to other document formats including Amazon Kindle, PDF and RTF.

* manage a local library/database of all imported ebooks, with easy editing of the bibliographic meta data of each ebook;

* synchronize the user's ebook library with ereading devices;

* edit ebooks in HTML source code, with live graphical preview.

Calibre calls itself 'the one stop solution to all your ebook needs'. And indeed, (small) publishers could use it as their single, one-size-fits-all tool for ebook production. If one wants to create text-oriented, standard-compliant ebooks, Calibre is the most accessible and straightforward authoring software currently available.

However, at its current version 2.5, Calibre is not perfect. For some aspects, other programs provide better functionality:

* Calibre's user interface is cluttered and can be confusing. The program has so many features and modules that it can feel like several programs jammed into one.

* The editor only supports EPUB 2.0 and is meant for tweaking the HTML and CSS code of imported documents, not for editing ebooks from scratch. That said, it provides good live graphical previews of the formatted document. Still, the editor is not the right tool for visual/multimedia-oriented publications. 

* The import/document conversion function is inferior to pandoc. In our tests, we obtained clearly better results converting Microsoft Word .docx and Markdown files to epub with pandoc than with Calibre. Calibre has the advantage of easy graphical operation, as opposed to the non-graphical command line interface of pandoc.

* Calibre's graphical viewer uses a simple HTML engine that is insufficient for testing and evaluating the visual design of an ebook. 

* Calibre's PDF export provides no real alternative to a PDF document carefully designed in a program like InDesign, or with custom templates using XML or other document formats. Here, pandoc is superior to Calibre as well.

Despite these limitations, Calibre is a capable program for importing simple text documents, tweaking them into an ebook  and exporting it to the most common ebook formats.  

Currently, the technically easiest and least expensive way of hybrid publishing is to transform a book into Markdown, edit the Markdown into a structurally clean document, use pandoc for converting Markdown to EPUB , and import the EPUB into Calibre for final tweaks and conversion into other e-book formats (including Amazon Kindle).

In a perfect future, Calibre would use pandoc as its import and document conversion engine, Readium for displaying e-books, and its document editor would be on par with iBooks Author for multimedia design while maintaining full compliance to the EPUB3 standard.  


###Enhancers: Adobe Digital Publishing Suite, Mag+
These applications mostly integrate (as plugins) in an existing Adobe InDesign and allow designers to define interactive content (media, animations, etc.) in a traditional print design. As such these tools are often used to convert print magazines into their digital counterparts suitable for sale in Apple's Newsstand, for example.

# 10 Futurology


## What we can expect
<!-- By Joost-->
*Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)*, is also the never ending question for the electronic publishing of art books.[^10-doris] In art books we try to describe, show, analyse and collect works of art. These works can be made of everything, but more often than not they deal with tactile objects, paintings, drawings, sculptures, etc. In many books these works are reproduced and discussed. But writing itself is also an art form and the mutual interaction between texts and tactile objects becomes more and more integrated. In the 20s and 30s of the previous century collages became very popular. Here texts, newspaper clippings, photographs and any other expressions, mostly on a paper substrate were put together to obtain a new artwork. In an electronic environment we transcend this collage technique into a new substrate: the pixel screen. Now, an enormous range of novel opportunities for creative expression becomes possible.

As we showed above in this guide, the act of glueing, dissecting and endlessly reorganizing enables us to create new works that can express themselves differently in different technological environments as well as being tailored to the readers‚Äôs desire of the moment of consumption. Electronic publishing becomes like a gigantic fruit salad bar, where the end user is able to or fill her own plate or to make a choice between prepared combinations. This not the same as blending all ingredients into one smoothie, which is an end phase from where no way back is possible. Below, we discuss some actual trends, though as we have seen over the past years the predictive power of fashion and hype is limited.


## Reading technology 

Changes seem dependent on genre, just as hard- and software dependencies. We have to take the intrinsic limitations of the latter two into account. Reading novels or other linear texts on ereaders is already a big success. Publishers report an ever increasing sales of eversions, that will surpass the sales of paper publications.[^10-Books] The open question is still are those books and articles read from screen or downloaded and print on paper. On the many self-publishing sites and web sites of official publishers we see millions of publications. But again, are all these works read sequentially like a detective or browsed/scrolled? How to handle a anthology with hundred poems? 

Also we see a saturation in the market of ereaders. Early birds like Sony are ending their efforts. This might be a result of the conflation of ereaders and the larger screen sizes of smartphones. Reading from a large smartphone becomes quite feasible. Typically, the big consumer electronics companies, stop developing ereaders in a market that is already mature and leave further advances to intermediates like Kobo.com. That is to say, hardware improvements are more or less on a plateau level and the real challenge will be the usages, which means the reading software, of ebooks. Browsing, annotating, sharing and quoting demands further software developments to mimic the versatility of paper books.

This goes without saying the intrinsic technological developments into color epaper screens, flexible screens and the continuing improvement of screen resolution Ultra High resolution (aka 4K) will certainly become something like Exa High in due course. 	

Also the big issue of reading from screen versus print-on-demand remains an open question.[^10-vanc] Again, it very much depends on the genre. Resent research shows that with the actual state of the art, students prefer paper above screens in the process of preparing for tests.[^10-stoop] So in the field of educational texts a new mixture will arise where paper textbooks and electronic examples, image, audio, and film collections and tests are written/developed in close collaboration. Also here textbooks loaded with pictures in fields like clinical medicine and art history will deviate from textbooks on theology and literature studies. Experiments will take a long time as evaluating educational courses takes many years. 

Nevertheless, advantages and disadvantages will remain the same on the level of affordability and portability of whole libraries versus independence from electricity and visual-tactile advantages of paper books. Related to this is the cloud hype, a fantastic development that relies totally on the availability of electricity and a working internet connection as well as the consistency of the host's services and platforms. Not to mention the 'anti-terrorist' filters of 'citizen friendly' governments.


## Reading culture 

Apart from the concerns expressed above, we have to review the culture of reading again. The present culture is that a person gets or buys a book and that is it. Now, more and more we are drifting to subscription models where the content as well as the software needed for consuming that content becomes unstable. 
Cost pressure that now chases us in the direction of cheaper ebooks might result in a dangerous dependency on a livelong financial contract.[^10-way] 
People living in poor, closed or financially weak countries might need a stable stock of material next to the unstable internet structure and related censorship.  

A major point in the present day discussion is the question of literacy. Nicolas Carr scared the world with his book *The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains* and on many internet forums and in many journals and magazines the discussion are vivid. We simple don't know. On the one hand people in many countries are trained by reading long texts and this competency might be influenced. On the other hand millions and millions of people from an illiterate background in  non-western countries get superb reading and writing skills by the use of mobile phones and tablets. On top of that in the Islamic world we know a strong oral tradition which is presently reflected in the avalanche of (often political of religious) video messages. Hence, in our project scope where we deal with arts and design we have to consider a increasing mixture of various medial productions. The accent now is more and more on short texts and the integration of short videos. Nothing and nobody can forecast if in a more mature technological environment the tides will turn and, next to other expressions, long written story telling will as well as well printed picture books will be come fashionable again. 


Other ways of dealing with texts allow a more interactive relationship between reader and text. Not only in the sense of adding audio and video, but also leaving the reader the choice of entry into the text, setting out an individual reader path per person. 

On the level of popularity and commerce we have to realise that the increasing -advertising driven- use of statistics, such as Facebook's like will highly influence the choice of our readers who have to many options to fill their spare time.


## Publishing culture

As we mentioned earlier, the subscription model now becomes the hegemonic model for the coming period. This will pertain to kind of products including books. However, here again we deal with a great variety. Big scholarly repositories such as JSTOR are different from sale platforms such as Amazon. Listening to relatively short music tracks (mostly less than 10 minutes)  via Spotify is different than reading relatively long texts (mostly longer than one hour). Likely: switch from individual product retail to rental/subscription model. Though the distribution model between music and text might converge. 

Given the great number of increasingly more powerful software writers and artist will try and disseminate their works more by who self-publish. However, at a certain point of overproduction, new intermediates, that is to say, publishers will pay a role again. 

For the publishers themselves it means that they more than ever must target to become the aggregator then the one time off producer. Sale platforms like Amazon become so large that they disable themselves to become coherent sources. 


Publishing always had in essence an editorial kernel. Unfortunately over the years it became more and more an industry of too many standardized products, where commercial short term objectives are the rue. With the advent of many self-publishing, vanity press, publishers that also rent out editorial services such as language brushing-up the 'art' and craftsmanship of publishing will re-establish herself in prioritizing the content, in his multimedia clothing, as linchpin between the creative artist and writer and the receptive reader, watcher, consumer.
Our Toolkit tries to be a helpful step in this direction.



[^10-doris]: This saying, by written by the Jay Livingston and Ray Evans became world famous when Doris Day sang it the song in the Hitchcock film *The Man Who Knew Too Much *(1956). www.youtube.com/watch?v=azxoVRTwlNg .

[^10-Books]: see eg.: http://www.thebookseller.com/news/digital-sales-outstrip-bricks-and-mortar-us

[^10-vanc]: Take for example the 528 pages (10,8 x 17,48 cm) thick anthology *What will be / Ce qui sera / Lo que ser√° *  Almanac of the international surrealist movement, with more than 170 contributors from 25 countries. Essays, poems, images, manifestoes, a debate on surrealist editions, chronology of 50 years of surrealism 1964-2014. Downloading such a book is problematic because you need a complete structured index and advanced search option. Printing it locally is almost impossible given the small fixed page size. Buying it at lulu.com gives you a POD on standard glossy paper, which is certainly not in line with the surrealist tradition.

[^10-way]: A related example is the notorious instability of the web as such. The big international science publisher has a contract with the Dutch Royal Library for a complete backup of its electronic collections. But the same library has , with many others, digital preservation as a spearhead in its policy. The private charity that maintains the wayback machine (http://archive.org/web/) that act as a carbon copy of the internet is a gem, but happens in case of major catastrophes?  

# 11 Glossary of technical terms

### **A**

*Acronym*
An acronym is a shortened version of a phrase, often taking the first letters. For example, GIGO is the acronym for 'Garbage in Garbage out' or WYSIWYG, otherwise known as 'What you see is what you get'. 

*Adware*
Any software which serves banner ads or pop-up ads to you while in use. It is sometimes installed in freeware or shareware which you download from the nets, and provides one more channel for advertisers to reach you. Some adware will also track your files, net usage, and software and report it back to advertisers to help them channel relevant ads to you. 

*Aliasing, anti-aliasing*
Pictures on your computer monitor are made up of square pixel. When the edge of a solid colored object in a GIF image is a diagonal or curved line, and it is displayed against a contrasting color, the edges appear jagged, like stair steps. This jagged appearance is called aliasing. The jagged appearance can be softened by filling in adjacent pixels with intermediate colors between the object and the background. This softening of the edges is called anti-aliasing. Software like PhotoShop can apply anti-aliasing for you automatically. One problem with anti-aliasing GIF images is that it increases the number of colors used, necessarily increasing the file size. You must decide whether quick loading or smoothed edges serves your needs better.

*Algorithm*
This is the name given to a "defined set of steps that can be used to complete a task". For example there are 'algorithms' worked out for sorting a list efficiently. A computer programmer can buy a book of algorithms so they not need to re-invent the wheel when they have to code for a job that has already been worked out. Having bought the book, they would look up the problem of 'How to sort a list' and a good book would tell them a number of ways to do this. Algorithms are not computer code,

*Android*
An Open Source operating system targeted at mobile phones, tablets. It's based on a Linux kernel and the Java programming language. As a mobile operating system Android is the most widely used.

*Amazon*
Online retailer of various goods, including ebooks, and producer of the Kindle and Fire ereading devices.

*App*
An application (software program) for mobile or desktop operating systems. Mobile apps are often distributed through an app store (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).

*App store*
An online store where mobile applications may be bought or obtained for free. Every major mobile operating system also has its own storefront for mobile apps - App Store (Apple), Google Play, Amazone Store, Windows Phone Store en BlackBerry App World.

*azw (Amazon Word)*
File format used by the Amazon Kindle e-Book reader.

*Anchor*
An 'anchor' is a specific location within a HTML-web page that can be jumped to by clicking on a hyperlink.

*Animated GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)*
A GIF2 graphic file, which consists of two or more images shown in a timed sequence to give the effect of motion.

*API (Application Programming Interface)*
An interface between the operating system and application programs that specifies how the two communicate with each other. 

*Applet*
An Applet is a small program that is downloaded from a web page and executed by browser software. Also, an HTML tag that defines an applet program which is written in Java and designed to run on a web page. It can be used to display scrolling text such as a marquee across the top of a page or other animations

*ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)*
A standard way to encode upper and lower case letters in the English alphabet, numbers, and special characters using only seven bits, and therefore limited to 128 characters.

*AVI (Audio Video Interleaved)*
A Microsoft video format where audio and video coding appears in alternate segments. AVI files will end with an .avi extension.

### **B**

*Bandwidth*
Literally, the frequency width of a transmission channel in Hertz, kiloHertz, megaHertz, etc. Often used as an expression of the amount of data that can be sent through a circuit. The greater the bandwidth, the greater the amount of data that can travel in a given time period.

*Baud*
Rate of transmission speed in a signal - the number of changes of state, such as voltage or frequency, per second in a signal. Named for the French teleprinter inventor Baudot. In simplest systems, it is synonymous with bits per second. In more complex systems, a baud may
include more than one bit.

*Binary*
A number system using base 2 instead of the usual (human) base 10, which is normally referred to as the decimal system. Computers use base 2 because they can only recognise two values, 1 or 0. This is simulated electronically by using a device, such as a switch, which is either on (1) or off (0). All numbers are represented by combinations of ones and zeroes, thus the number 9 is represented as 1001, the right-most column being the units column and the other columns, moving from right to left, being 2, 4, 8.

*Bit*
Contraction of *binary digit*. A bit is the smallest measurement unit of computer memory or data transmission speed.

*Bitmap*
A computer graphic which is defined by specifying the colors of dots or pixels which make up the picture. Also known as raster graphics. Common types of bitmap graphics are GIF, JPEG, Photoshop, PCX, TIFF, Macintosh Paint, Microsoft Paint, BMP, PNG, FAX formats, and TGA. The file extention is .BMT.

*Blog*
Short for web log; usually a chronological record of thoughts, links, events, or actions posted on the web.

*Browser*
Software that will load and display a web page. A browser interprets the HTML or XML code from the web page files, executes embedded scripts and programs, provides encryption/decryption for security where needed, displays graphics (except text-only browsers), plays music and video, and provides links to related pages. Browsers are based on standards
developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. The major browser software developers participate in these standards, but each of them also builds in their own proprietary codes, whether or not they are approved. These differences in browsers create a challenge for web page developers.

*Byte*
A measurement of computer memory or disc capacity. A byte comprises 8 *bits*.

### **C**

*CAD/CAM*
Abbreviations for Camputer Aided Design / Computer Aided Manufacturing. A process of drafting, designing and manufacturing with the aid of acomputer. CAD enables the user to manipulate drawings, including 3D drawings, and viewing them from a variety of angles. CAM is a general term for computer support during the manufacturing process.

*CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)*
Cascading Style Sheets are a feature of HTML4 that enables a range of styles for headers, body text, bullet points, links etc., to be specified for hypertext documents. This makes it possible to set up CSS file containing a library of styles that are used throughout a website, thereby facilitating consistency. If a style needs to be changed throughout a website it only needs to be changed once in the CSS file and then it will be applied automatically.

*CMS (Content Management System)*
A software package that makes it possible for non-technical users to publish content (text, images, etc) on a website.

*Compatiblity*
Pieces of hardware and/or software which are capable of being used together are described as *compatible*.

*Compression*
Compression is a technique to make a file or a data stream smaller for faster transmission or to take up less storage space. There a number of programs that will compress files, such as PKZIP, WinZip, Stuffit, gnu zip, and many more. Files with the following extensions are almost always compressed files: arc, arj, gz, lha, lhz, taZ, taz, tgz, Z, zip, and zoo.

*Computer Program*
A set of instructions that the computer carries out in sequence to perform a given task. Programs are written in English-like programming languages (e.g. C, Pascal, JAVA, C++) , and are then converted into binary machine instructions via a compiler or an interpreter.

*Cookie*
A cookie is a short file put on your system by a web page when the user visits a website for  the first time. It includes information about your usage and facilitates the current interaction. For example, it may include the information that you have logged into a passworded area already in the current session and don't need a second password check.
There are many uses for cookies, they may be erased at the end of a session or retained until the next session, and they may be encrypted or in plain text. If retained, the next time that the user visits that site, the information in the cookie is sent back to the site so that the site can tailor what it presents to the user, e.g. tastes in music or shopping habits.

### **D**

*Data*
Strictly speaking the plural of "datum",but now usually considered as a collective noun in the singular, with the plural form "data items" or "items of data". Data is information in a form which can be processed by a computer. It is usually distinguished from a *computer program*, which is a set of instructions that a computer carries out. Data can be text
or sets of figures on which a computer program operates.

*Device*
An electronic handheld device like a smartphone, tablet, phablet, personal digital assitant (pda)or portable gaming device (PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Vita).

*DRM ([Digital Rights Management](id:Digital Rights Management))*
Technology used by digital publishers to control the usage of copyright protected material. The practice is controversial as it often hampers paying customers in freely interacting with digital goods (MP3, EPUB, games, etc.). Transferring items with DRM to other devices or using them without an active Internet connection often proves to be dificult.
<!-- possible link: http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/05/29/the-book-as-directory/ -->  

*DTP (Desktop Publishing)*
Is the practice of designing printed matter on a personal computer, often using software like Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress.

*Directory*
A location on a disc containing a group of *files*and *subdirectories* grouped together for organisational purposes. The term is used synonymously with Folder, which has become a more common term since the introduction of Windows'. Subdirectories are sometimes referred to as
"child directories" of the "parent directory". The topmost directory on a computer, which is the parent of all directories on the disc, is known as the *root directory* and usually has the *pathname* C:\\\\<!-- Double \ used to espace meta value of \ in Mardown and display C:\\ literaly  -->
*Dithering*
The technique of combining dots of primary colours to give the appearance of intermediate colours. Dots are combined in a square area, known as a *dither matrix,* to simulate a dot of an intermediate colour.

*DOS (Disk Operating System)*
An operating system for desktop PCs developed by Microsoft from 1981 to 1995.

*Dot Matrix Printer*
An older type of printer that works by firing sets of pins in different combinations at an ink ribbon located against a sheet of paper. Such printers produce text that looks "ragged". Laser printers and ink-jet printers are now much more common.

*Dpi (Dots Per Inch)*
A measure of the of the quality of output, i.e. the number of dots per square inchproduced by a *printer* or *scanner*, also referred to as its *resolution*. A resolution of at least 300 dpi is considered reasonable for the production of
high-quality output by a printer and 1200 dpi by a scanner, but modern printers and scanners can produce many more dots per square inch. The resolution of a scanner may also be expressed by two numbers. These are mostly the same, e.g. 1200 x 1200, but you may also see 1200 x 2400, which means that the number of horizontal dots is different from the number of vertical dots

### **E**

*ebook*
A range of digital publications which can be read by ereaders, desktop computers and handheld devices.

*EPUB (Electronic Publication)*
An ebook format developed by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). EPUB has been designed to accommodate reflowable content.

*ereader*
A device capable of reading digital texts in various formats, notably EPUB and AZW.

*E-ink*
Electrophoretic ink, a sytem in whch small particals are electrostatically charged in such a way they can become black or white and remain so. Hence, electricity is in fact only used by refreshing the page, which reduces considerably the power consumption and makes it an ideal technology for long reading. The resolution of the stable screen is very high. A disadvantage is that, like paper, the presentation does not allow motion pictures or animations.

*Encryption*
A system of coding that helps prevent access to private information on computer networks or on the Web.

### **F**

*FAQ*
Abbreviation for Frequently Asked Question(s).

*File*
A *file* in computer jargon can be used to describe many different things. It may be a Computer Program, a document file created with a Word-processor, an image file, an audio file, a video file, etc. Think of it in the same way as you would think of a file in a filing cabinet. A file has a name that describes what it is, and the file is stored in a
place where you can easily find it.

*File extension*
One popular method used by many operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS is to determine the format of a file based on the end of its name‚Äîthe letters following the final period. This portion of the filename is known as the filename extension. For example, HTML documents are identified by names that end with .html (or .htm), and GIF images by .gif. In the past names were limited to an eight-character identifier and a three-character extension. There are only a limited number of three-letter extensions, so, often any given extension might be linked to more than one program. Many formats still use three-character extensions even though modern operating systems and application programs no longer have this limitation. Since there is no standard list of extensions, more than one format can use the same extension, which can confuse both the operating system and users.

*File format*
A file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. It specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium. File formats may be either proprietary or free and may be either unpublished or open. A specific file format demands specific programs to read.

*File Permissions*
Files stored on a computer usually have *permissions* governing which users are allowed to read, amend or execute them. This is particularly important in a a school, college or university network environment, where teachers and lecturers may have the permission to amend certain files, e.g. documents that they have created, but students are only allowed to read them. File permissions are usually determined by network managers.

*Flat text*
 Text without any visual characteristics, so without bolding, italics, etc.
 
*Formatting*
The process of preparing a writeable disc for use. Formatting creates a structure on the disc which enables it to hold data.

*Freemium*
A revenue model whereby the base product is free of charge, but can be extended with paid options or plugins.

### **G**

*GIF (Graphic Interchange Format)*
A file format used for storing simple graphics. GIF files use a palette of 256 colours, which makes them practical for almost all graphics except photographs. Generally, GIF files should be used for logos, line drawings, icons, etc, i.e. images that don't contain a rich range of colours. A GIF file containing a small number of colours tends to be quite small, but it will be big if the image has a wide range of colours, e.g. a photograph.GIF files are commonly used for storing images on the Web. GIF files are also suitable for storing animated (i.e. moving) images.

*GitHub*
Collaboration platform, code review, and code management for open source and private projects.

*GUI (Graphical User Interface)*
An Interface, i.e. a software package, that enables human beings to control what happens on their computers. A GUI consists of graphical elements known as icons and enables the user to run programs and to carry out other operations such as copying information from one Folder/directory to another, deleting files, etc by clicking on these icons, opening and shutting windows and dragging and dropping with a mouse.

### **H**

*Hexadecimal*
A number system used in computers in which numbers are composed of combinations of 16 digits, using 0-9 then the letters A-F to represent 10-15. Hex allows binary numbers to be expressed in a more compact and comprehensible form. For example, 255 = FF (hex) = 11111111 (binary)

*HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)*
A markup language based on SGML. The coding system used for creating pages on the World Wide Web. HTML enables the author to control how the page appears and to insert Hypertext links within one Web page or to other pages anywhere on the Web.

*HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)*
The transfer method (*protocol*) used by the World Wide Web to transmit and receive Web pages.

*Hyperlink*
A contraction of hypertext link, the essence of Hypertext and the HTML language used for creating pages on the World Wide Web. In a Web document a hyperlink can be a sequence of letters or an image. By clicking on the area designated as a hyperlink by the person who created the Web page, it is possible to jump quickly to another part of the page, a different page on the same website, or to a completely different website.

*Hypertext*
A system for the non-sequential presentation of text, the fundamental concept of the World Wide Web, whereby the user can jump from one part of a text to another, from one Web page to another, or from one website to another, by clicking on highlighted (and usually underlined) hyperlinks. The concept of hypertext predates the Web by many years.

### **I**

*iBooks*
A program enabling the user to read and buy ebooks, developed by Apple for iOS and OS X.

*iBookstore*
Apple's storefront for EPUBs and iBooks.

*iOS*
Mobile operating, originally called iPhone OS before June 2010, which runs on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV.

*iPad*
Tablet introduced by Apple, controlled by touch gestures.

*Icon*
A small symbol or picture used in a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The icons on the computer screen represent programs or files, e.g. a picture of a painter's palette might represent a program used for drawing and editing pictures, and a picture of a book with a question mark on its cover might represent the text of a manual or a help file.

*Ink Jet Printer*
A type of Printer that fire little jets of ink at the page in order to form the characters and graphics. One of the commonest forms of printers currently in use and capable of producing high-quality output in black and white and in full colour.

*Interface*
An interface in computer jargon is a connection between two systems. It can be Hardware or Software. It may take the form of a plug, cable or socket, or all three, for example where a Printer or Scanner is connected to a computer, and then it's a hardware interface. There are also software interfaces that enable one program to link with another, passing across data and variables. The term interface, also known as user interface, also describes the software that is used to enable human beings to communicate with a computer.

*Internet*
The Internet, or simply "the Net", is a computer network connecting millions of computers all over the world. It provides communications to governments, businesses, universities, schools and homes. Any modern computer can be connected to the Internet using existing communications systems. Schools and universities normally access the Internet via their own educational networks, but private individuals usually have to take out a subscription with an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Although the Internet is in fact a network of networks, it appears to users as a network of individual computers. The Internet dates back to the group of interconnected networks that evolved from the ARPANET of the late 60's and early 70's. It has grown from a handful of interconnected networks into a huge network of millions of computers.

*iPod*
The name of a portable (mobile) Media Player designed and marketed by Apple.

*IT(C) (Information Technology)*
Essentially, technology relating to information processing, i.e. computer technology, The term IT is rapidly being replaced by ICT in order to reflect the important role that information technology plays in communications by email, the Web, satellites and mobile phones.

### **J**

*Java*
Java is a high level programming language. It is useful for creating small web applications and applets for use as part of a web page.

*JavaScript*
JavaScript is a scripting language originally developed by Netscape mainly for use as code within a web page.

Javascript is very popular for common tasks such as validating data entry forms within a web page before they are submitted to the server. Javascript can also alter the way a page looks by dynamically changing CSS format settings within its page.

*AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML)*
A popular technology closely linked with JavaScript, used to update details on a web page without having to fully refresh it.

jQuery
JavaScript library providing a set of convenience methods for programmers in order to dynamically manipulate webpages.

*JPEG or JPG (Joint Photographic Expert Group)*
Pronounced "Jaypeg". A file format used for storing images. The JPEG/JPG format uses a palette of millions of colours and is primarily intended for photographic images. The internal compression algorithm of the JPEG/JPG format, unlike the GIF format, actually throws out superfluous information, which is why JPEG/JPG files containing photographic images end up smaller than GIF files containing photographic images. If you store an image, say, of a flag containing just three colours in JPEG/JPG format it may end up bigger than a GIF file containing the same image, but not necessarily a lot bigger - it depends on the type and range of colours it contains. JPEG/JPG files containing photographic images are normally smaller than GIF files containing photographic images.

Businesses and educational institutions often use PDF-formatted files to display the original look of their brochures or for publishing a complete magazine in electronic format. Using the full Adobe Acrobat software package, it is possible to create a high-quality piece of artwork or a brochure which preserves the look of the original, complete with fonts, colours, images, and formatting. Documents in PDF format can be published on the Web without having to be converted into HTML.

*Pixel*
A contraction of picture element. What you see on a computer Display Screen1 is made up of thousands of coloured pixels or small dots, which can be set according to the user's choice to produce either low-resolution output, medium-resolution output or high-resolution output, the usual combinations of pixels across each line of the screen (horizontal pixels) and down each line of the screen (vertical pixels) being 640 x 480, 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, 1280 x 1024. Thus, the more pixels on the screen the higher the resolution (i.e. producing a finer, sharper image) and the greater the variety of colours that can be displayed.

*Platform*
Often used as an alternative term for a computer system, including both the hardware and the software. Essentially this term describes something that is used to build something else. The term *platform-independent* - used to describe software - means that the software can be run on any computer.

*POD (Print-on-Demand)*
Print on demand (POD) is a digital printing technology in which a book or other publication is printed in the amount one needs it. The POD model flies in the face of traditional printing, where large quantities of books are produced in initial print runs to reduce costs prior to distribution. The sales of online books and e-books facilitate POD and eliminate the need for hard copy book displays. POD has also changed the publishing industry by reducing the need for traditional publishing houses, allowing authors to self-publish at very low costs. Print on demand is sometimes called publish on demand.

*Program*
The American spelling is standard in computer jargon, enabling a useful distinction to be made in British English between a *computer program* and a *programme* in the sense of a *programme of study*. A talk with the title "Turning programmes into programs" (or maybe it was the other way round) was presented by a British Council officer at the annual TESOL conference in the USA in 1987 - which puzzled the American audience but made sense to the British participants.

One normally talks in terms of the quality of resolution, using the expression low-resolution, medium-resolutionand high-resolution. The resolution of a computer display screenis normally expressed as two numbers representing the horizontal and vertical resolution, i.e. dots across each line of the screen and down each line of the screen: e.g. 640 x 480, 1024 x 768, etc. The resolution of a Printer is normally referred to by the number of dots per inch (dpi)- i.e. square inch.

*RTF (Rich Text Format)*
An alternative way of storing a document created with a MS-Word-processor. RTF-formatted files can be moved relatively easily between different computer systems.

*Vector Graphic*
A method of creating graphic images on a computer by telling it to draw lines in particular positions. An advantage of a *vector graphic* is that it can be enlarged or reduced in size without loss of sharpness or distortion. Most modern image creation and edtiting packages can save images in vector graphic format. Vector graphics can be contrasted with *bit-mapped graphics*, which are made of a fixed number of pixels (small dots), and therefore sharpness may be lost when the image is resized.

*Vodcast*
A contraction of Video Podcast. A type of Podcast1 that incoporates video as well as audio.

### *W*

*WAV (Waveform Audio Format)*
A format for storing high-quality audio files.

*Word-processor*
Probably the most widely used computer Application. Modern word-processors allow the user to create fine-looking documents including images, tables, photographs, and even sound and video recordings if they are to be viewed on screen rather than from the printed page. In many respects they are similar to *Desktop Publishing* applications. Word-processors normally include a spellchecker, a grammar checker, a style checker and a thesaurus, as well as tools for writing in HTML, the coding language used for producing Web pages.Word-processors have been widely used in teaching and learning foreign languages ever since they first appeared.

*WWW (World Wide Web)*
Usually referred to simply as the Web. This is the most powerful and fastest growing Internet service. The World Wide Web was the brainchild of Tim Berners-Lee, who in 1989 invented the HTML coding language that is the basis of the Web. The Web became a public service in 1993. It is a huge collection of resources of information, including learning materials, which is accessed by means of a computer program known as a Browser. The World Wide Web is only part of the Internet, but many people treat both terms as synonyms.

*WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)*

XML is a specification emanating from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows Web designers to create their own language for displaying documents on the Web. XML is an extension to the standard language for creating Web pages, HTML, and makes it possible to create websites containing more complex interactivity.

*[XHTML](id:XHTML)(Extensible Hypertext Markup Language)*
A markup language mainly used to produce websites. It generally has the same characteristics as HTML, but has a stricter syntax which allow it to be easily read by an XML-parser.

## NAI/010 Publishers
The project for NAI/010 Publishers has two technical components. A mobile web application, called My Highlights, allowing a user to browse a large collection and create an EPUB based on a personal selection of objects from this collection. The other is a set of WordPress plugins, extending the functionality of the WordPress JSON REST API ([WP-API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API)) and facilitate the generation of EPUBs using the content from a WordPress database. The latter is basically a packaged version of the CakePHP EPUB component that builds on Asbj√∏rn Grandt's PHPePub.

## Valiz
For Valiz Publishers an online EPUB generator was developed using CakePHP and a set of open-source libraries, notably [PHPePub](https://github.com/Grandt/PHPePub) by Asbj√∏rn Grandt. The project was developed with relatively low-cost and low-feature [^low-feature-explanation] webhosting in mind, allowing it to be run on a broad range of hosting environments. Notable features include support for endnotes and a WYSIWYG editor based on HTML5's `contenteditable` mechanism. The platform allows publishers to author and generate EPUBs suitable for distribution in various bookstores.
