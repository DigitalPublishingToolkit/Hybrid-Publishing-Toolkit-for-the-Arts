Genres of Publication
======================


#### Art/Design Catalogue like
 
- Heavy in use of images
- images take central role over texts
- images are primary (text refers to images)
- Descriptive texts of changing lengths

Issues and advantages of going electronic:

One the main issues which arise when trying to go electronic with Art/Design catalogue-like publications lies in the use of images. The quality of the images is important. Images must often be high in quality with as little distortion of colours as possible. 
	An advantage of going electronic with this type of publication could lie in the use of other (interactive) materials and easier distribution. 

#### Research-like publication 

- heavy in use of text
- texts take a central role
- images are secondary (images refer to texts)
- often longer texts

Issues and advantages of going electronic:

One of the issues with going electronic with a research-like publication is setting parameters for the use of and interaction between text and images. Advantages of going electronic with this type of publication have to do with the wider reach and availability of the content. Making the text available digitally could increase its spreading. This is often a goal of research-like publications. 


#### Art/design periodical


- Heavy in use of texts and images
- Both images and texts take central role
- Use of images is both primary and secondary
- Texts of changing lengths
- Recurring publication format


Issues and advantages of going electronic:

One of the issues with going digital with a Art/Design periodical lies in the limitations of the digital medium. The periodical thrives well by its physcical presence. It can be tossed in a bag and just as easily be disposed of. In a digital form the physical pressence becomes limited. An advantage of going electronic with a(n) (Art/design) periodical lies in the increased possibilities in extending content (interactivity, video etc.). Another specific advantage of the periodical lies in the decreasing of distribution costs and the convenience with which a large audience can be reached.


#### Artist's/experimental books

- Heavy in use of images
- Images (often) take a central role 
- Use of images is (often) primary
- Use of text changes, may completely be absent
- No specific set of characteristics

Issues and advantages of going electronic:

An issue with making a digital publication out of an Artist's/experimental book is the choice of material. The choice to go digital in this case is the most fundamental. Furthermore, here too, the quality of images and the relation between text and images is important. The choices which are being made by the creator influence the final outcome immensely. Advantages of going digital lie in the more extensive possibilities digitalisation offers (e.g. interactive material etc.).

#### New types of publications

By new types of publications we mean publications which cannot easily be placed in one of the genres mentioned above. These could be publications which fall outside of what we would normally consider a 'book'. Examples could be an app or a series of tweets etc. Setting a predisposed set of parameters for this genre is difficult.
