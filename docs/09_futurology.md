# 09 Futurology 


<div class="summary">
- Customization and curation appear to be key concepts in future electronic publishing.
- Classical e-readers seem to lose importance while more and more people read on their standard mobile devices.
- E-reading and paper books will likely continue to coexist.
- Flatrate subscriptions to whole ebook catalogues will likely become more common and disrupt today's publishing and library culture.
- Self-publishing will likely grow more.
- Reciprocally, there may be more need to editorial selection and content curation.

In the 20th century, mass media and new art forms were closely interrelated. It is, for example, almost impossible to think of cubist, Dadaist and pop art collage outside a mass culture of newspaper publishing. With electronic publishing, acts of dissecting, glueing and perpetual reorganizing have become technologically and culturally more complex - and more common. In this Toolkit, we have called this the 'modularization' of electronic publishing. Personalized, individually curated, or 'collaged' content is possible both on the side of the producer and of the receiver. On top of that, readers choose their own combinations of reading technologies. There is no reason to believe that the great diversity of reading software and hardware will diminish. Maybe it will even increase further (much in contrast to five years ago, when many people believed that Apple's iPad would become the most common electronic reading device). 

Is it possible then to make general statements about the future of e-publishing? We do see some real trends, although, of course, predictions are questionable in a field so prone to fashions and hypes.

## Technology 
Reading novels and other conventional texts on e-readers is already common and has been an industry success. Publishers report ever-increasing sales of ebooks. It is quite possible that one day, electronic publication sales will surpass those of paper publications.[^books] 

At the same time, the market for e-reading devices seems to be saturated. Early mass producers of monochrome e-readers like Sony have quit, and their further development is left to smaller companies like Kobo. This might be a result of the popularity of tablets and smartphones. Since smartphones are bought with increasingly large screens, it looks as if those two types of devices are about to converge. Reading from a large smartphone is quite feasible, and it is a device which their owners have with them anyway, wherever they are. Generally speaking, and beyond the narrow area of ebooks, it is fair to assume that at least in Western and Southeast Asian countries, people spend more time reading on electronic devices than on print.

Technological developments in higher quality screens are underway - such as color e-paper screens, flexible and Ultra High Density resolution (4k) screens. However, contemporary research shows that students still prefer paper to screens when they prepare for tests.[^stoop] In the field of educational texts, we already see a new mix of paper textbooks and electronic materials (such as image, audio, and film collections and interactive tests) written and developed to complement each other. Where paper publications are used for reading complex texts, (portable) electronic devices will simultaneously be used for the purpose of search and meta-tagging, to comment and debate on the content. 

All these developments may be brought to areas outside of education. It remains to be seen whether "social reading" - browsing, annotating, sharing and quoting - will really take off for ebooks, or whether it will remain the domain of classical social media like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. So far, the respective efforts (by established companies like Kobo and startups like Sobooks) have not lived up to expectations.

Print-on-demand (POD) publications are another area of continued growth, filling a gap between traditional and electronic publishing.[^vanc] 

With their affordability and portability, extensive digital libraries are an epochal gain. But it comes at the price of dependence on electricity and loss of the visual tactility of paper books. The two media may diverge from each other precisely on the basis of this difference: paper books could become design objects and gradually cease to be mass media. All the while, electronic books may replace generic text books such as paperbacks - and will mostly be used as parts of vast digital libraries. In a long-term perspective, this might push print publishing into a similar crafty niche as calligraphy after Gutenberg and letterpress books after the invention of photo typesetting.

Where will the electronic libraries be stored, and who will control their access? The so-called "cloud" relies on permanently available electricity, on a dense and fast Internet infrastructure and on hardware/software platform consistency. Who will guarantee that 'the cloud' with all your books will always be maintained, kept open and accessible, let alone unfiltered or not subject to surveillance and censorship? 

## Reading and book culture 
In reading culture and book retail, we foresee a shift from buying and owning individual ebooks towards "all you can read" subscription models. Just as the music and film industry (with Spotify and Netflix respectively), the publishing industry is moving towards flatrate packages. In the US, Oyster Books offers a 'streaming service' for books, and Amazon has recently launched its "Kindle Unlimited" program with access to 600,000 ebooks for a monthly fee of $10.[^oyster] Such services have major drawbacks: libraries become unreliable since their books are no longer owned by their readers and subject to unpredictable changes or even loss. Such electronic books will no longer be stored on people's devices, but accessed via an application from a remote server. Both the application and the server, however, might disappear overnight. The same economic pressures that currently force the industry to make ebooks cheaper may well  end up disempowering readers. 

The commerce of publishing will be increasingly advertisement-driven. Statistical data-mining of consumer habits, as it is already practiced by Facebook, Google and Amazon, will influence consumers' choices. This model could skyrocket once subscription models get widely adopted. Then, user statistics and 'Big Data' will be at the heart of the publishing industry's business. 

Flatrate ebook subscriptions will eventually threaten today's public libraries. These new models manifest an attractive cost-cutting opportunity for policymakers. Sweeping cuts into yet another part of public services and infrastructure are, no doubt, on the horizon. At the same time, the new electronic libraries will level the global playing field of higher education: first-class research libraries will then no longer be exclusive to traditional, highly funded, Western universities. 

How will people read? Are ebooks read from beginning to end or rather browsed - or just kept as searchable items in a personal electronic library? Are PDF versions of books and articles read from screen or first printed on paper? How much content is merely read by bots and search engines? Will attention spans decline (the old criticism of any new medium) or, on the contrary, will long, complex texts and printed books become fashionable again in a more mature technological environment? It is very possible that in the course of time, users will adjust to new reading technologies and have no trouble digesting long and complex texts from the displays of their mobile devices. 

## The future of publishing culture? 
Already today, more and more writers and artists self-publish their works. The role of publishers as book producers is becoming one of the past. However, at a certain point of overproduction, publishers may redefine their role and become aggregators and curators. A young publisher like Zero Books (whose authors are mostly select critical theory bloggers) demonstrates that this model already works today. All the while, sales platforms like Amazon have become too large to provide a competitive level of selection and curatorship; even their statistics-driven customer personalization has proven a failure in this respect.

The electronic publishing we have focused on in this Toolkit, with technologies like EPUB, may sometimes appear counter-intuitive to today's digital media culture: Why create, in essence, offline web sites in zip files, in an age of "clouds" and always-on networking? The ephemerality of networked media clashes with a desire to personally curate, collect and preserve what otherwise would soon be lost. This makes, as we found out in our project, such stubborn offline technologies as EPUB files appealing. [^warwick]

With the advent of many self-publishing and self-curating options on the one side, and the gigantic monopolies forming on the other, the art and craftsmanship of publishing will need to re-invent itself. With this Toolkit, we hope to contribute one building block.

[^vanc]: Take for example the 528 pages (10,8 x 17,48 cm) thick anthology *What will be / Ce qui sera / Lo que ser√° Almanac* of the international surrealist movement, with more than 170 contributors from 25 countries. Essays, poems, images, manifestoes, a debate on surrealist editions, chronology of 50 years of surrealism 1964-2014. Downloading such a book is problematic because of the need of a complete, structured index and advanced search options. Printing it locally is almost impossible because of its small fixed page size. Buying it at lulu.com gives readers a print-on-demand book on standard glossy paper which is certainly not in line with the surrealist tradition.
