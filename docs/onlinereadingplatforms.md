### Online reading platforms: Scribd, Issuu, website / blog // Miriam

Online reading platforms are browser-based platforms where digital publications are uploaded and made available. The publication can be presented in different formats. The choice for an online platform and the accompanying publication format also has effect on modes and reach of distribution.

Below several platforms are discussed, including characteristics, statistics, strenghts and weaknesses, and how-to.


####Issuu

**Characteristics**
Issuu can be found at http://www.issuu.com
It offers many options to distribute works: In-screen reading with flippable pages, downloadable files, embedding of the readable format on your own website. It is used for books, brochures, magazines, etc. Because it is possible to upload a designed PDF it is a good way to publish styled and colourful publications.
