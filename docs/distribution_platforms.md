## Distribution platforms

Many channels exist for distributing ebooks. Curiously, most traditional retailers (large bookshops, like Libris or AKO in the Netherlands) play a marginal role in the selling of electronic publications, with the exception of a company like Barnes & Noble with their range of Nook devices and associated storefront. Large players in the field include Amazon, Apple, Google, Barnes & Noble, Sony and Kobo.
