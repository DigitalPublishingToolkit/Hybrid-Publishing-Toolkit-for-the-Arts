# 08 Guide: Epublications per Genre

## General questions

## [Research publication](id:Research publication)
### General
Currently, there are intense discussions about changing the forms of research publications in both sciences and humanities. The idea is to transition from the classical textbook model to new forms of publication that allow more complex forms of visualization, inclusion of real time data, and computation. One would normally expect that electronic publishing provides the technical solution for these issues. However, this is not today's reality. If one wants to publish in standard ebook formats and target a broad range of electronic reading platforms and devices, the visual and multimedia possibilities of current ebook technology are, as a matter of fact, much more limited than in paper publishing. <!--why? this needs example/explanation/reference -Miriam--> The alternative, to develop research publications as visual apps, will in most cases not be a viable solution because apps have short lifespans of technical compatibility while research publishing is long-term (and long-tail) publishing almost by definition. 

Pragmatically and for the near future, electronic research publishing will mean the publishing of conventionally designed papers, journals and textbooks in electronic form. In other words, electronic research publishing will typically evolve around text-centered works. This means that the advice given for [research-type publications](researchlikepub.html) elsewhere in this publication will apply to most electronic research publications. 

### Traditional workflow

In print research publications, the typical workflow has been:

* An editor works with author(s) on the manuscript.
* Several versions of the manuscript are going back and forth between different people in different roles (editor, author, copyeditor, designer).
* The final version of the manuscript will be established in a word processing program (typically Microsoft Word) or desktop publishing program (typically Adobe InDesign).
* A graphic designer will design the publication in InDesign.  
* Corrections are made to the print proof and added in the InDesign file.  
* A PDF file of the corrected InDesign file goes to printer.

In Chapter 7 <!-- internal link needed-->we describe how to create electronic books from an InDesign project. However, this entails careful planning and meticulous internal structuring of the InDesign document that is untypical for the way book projects are being made today, and for which most graphic designers working with InDesign have not been trained.
 
### New workflow  
We propose a new workflow that is directed towards diverse sources and hybrid output to various media (including print, ebook and web). It is centered around a single editorial and archival file format, a definitive version of the document that enables multiple output. Instead of a final Word file which is changed in InDesign - both of which are not very good formats to convert to EPUB â€“ the editorial and archival file will be in a format that can easily translate into InDesign for the print edition and EPUB / mobi / web for the electronic publication. The most suitable format for this is Markdown with the MultiMarkdown extensions - because it allows footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies, and translation to InDesign, EPUB and web is very straightforward using the open source software tool pandoc.

### New possibilities ###
A hybrid workflow geared towards epublications as well as print, offers a number of advantages:

* Easy translation into various electronic file formats, as explained above.
* User-friendly tools like wikis and blogs can be used for collaborative editing and revision control, leading up to even more sophisticated systems like Git and GitHub (traditionally used for software development by large teams of programmers distributed over the whole world).
* Adding elements other than text (videos, images, links) while keeping them separate from the document file. This prevents gigantic file sizes of the central editorial document. It also makes it easier to maintain images and videos in different resolutions for different publication media. 
* Easy extraction of derived output from the book itself, such as abstracts, video book trailers, newsletters, personalized epublications; easier extraction of parts of a publication that will be separately published.
* Independence from one particular software program (such as Word and InDesign), long-time archivability.

### Instructions

#### Style guide ####
A new workflow requires certain actions to obtain the suitable input for the publication. First of all, it is necessary to communicate this to all contributors (authors, editors, designers) in the publishing process. <!--internal link to chapter 6. And check if it is not double - Miriam--> Publication style guides must be adjusted accordingly and specify:

* the file format to be delivered by contributors (for example: Markdown, or .docx pending later conversion and formatting clean-up);
* in case of .docx, require the author to use defined paragraph and character styles for all formatting (such as "Headline 1", "Headline 2", "quotation" etc.) - and to strictly avoid direct formatting of text. Microsoft provides [a useful introduction](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Style-basics-in-Word-d382f84d-5c38-4444-98a5-9cbb6ede1ba4) on this;
* image style and format; high-resolution images that are suitable for print but can be downsized to lower resolutions for electronic publication;  
* metadata the author needs to provide such as keywords, contact information, abstract, biography;
* metadata to be added by the editor/publisher.

Editorial criteria for the content can also differ in a hybrid workflow:  

* differents style of writing, 'writing for the web' vs. 'writing for print;  
* the inclusion of interactive material, more or other images than can be published in print, video, audio, etc.




## Art/design catalogue
Catalogue Digital Approaches

![Catalogue Approach](images/08_WorkflowCatalogus.png "Catalogue Digital Approaches") 

<!--Image: very rough sketch -->


### General
traditional workflow = InDesign workflow as described before, production of one integral publication

vs. new workflow = highly modularized publication. 

### Decision making
Should there be a 1:1 transfer from paper book to ebook?, What are alternative possibilities?

In most cases, today, an art catalogue is difficult to translate 1:1 to an electronic publication, simply because of file sizes. It's advisable to split it up into smaller publications, such as monographic micro-ebooks on single art works, or collections of articles that each reader can individually choose from and obtain as an automatically customized e-book.

### Instructions
1:1 translations into electronic publication: target one reading medium (in most cases: tablets). Strongly consider PDF over EPUB if the focus is on images, and image composition requires a fixed layout. Target a 10" tablet screen with a resolution between 1024x768 and 1920x1080. Work in InDesign, and make - if necessary - a customized new page layout that fits these dimensions. Consider small additions of interactive and multimedia elements by using Adobe Acrobat Pro as a final authoring tool. (This is part of the Adobe Creative Suite). Consider this project a short- to medium-term project that might have become technically obsolete/outmoded in 3-5 years.

Custom translation into modularized publications: EPUB is the file format of choice because it is internally modular (being nothing more than a zip archive of individual HTML files, images, fonts etc). Have a web developer program a simple custom server application that can customize, zip and upload an EPUB file according to a user's web form input. Also consider generating this EPUB from a database/content management system.

### Specific issues for this publication type
Above all: file size because of number and resolution of included images.
Solutions: 

- Modularize content (by in-app download, see for an example the  Stedelijk project)

- Create separate low-res and hi-res versions; can also be used as a business model (free or cheap low-res book, pay for hi-res book). Explain how on-the-fly resolution adjustment is easy with epub (using server-side scripting for resizing images and zipping the epub file), this is not so easy with PDF.

- Question/issue: Is a catalogue in the traditional definition a desirable publication format for e-publishing, or do we (a) have to think up new forms of small/smart catalogues, or (b) wait for more device storage capacity and network speed to arrive in the future? At the moment, producing a 100+ pages hi-resolution catalogue electronically does not make sense, except as heavy PDF files for desktop computer viewing. <!-- Pia: why doesnt this make sense?-->

### Based on the above, what to choose?

How to make an art/design catalogue in EPUB2/3, HTML5 (/app), PDF

A step-by-step guide

- Consolidate text in Markdown, consolidate images in highest resolution

- For EPUB and HTML5: Use thumbnails for images in order to avoid excessive file sizes, convert with Markdown, employ designer

- Employ editorial/interaction designer to think up new publication format

## Artist/designer book 
<!--less oriented from publishers perspective. Loes might have a proposal. //1000 words //Florian-->

<!-- ![Periodical Approach](images/08_artistbook.png "Periodical Digital Approaches") -->

Flow chart: workflow

### General
traditional vs. new workflow

Traditional workflow: book as conceptual design object or even sculptural object

New workflows:

- make a book simply as a series of page-size images, can be easily converted into screen-readable PDF, EPUB and HTML5

- Look at visual tools like Calibre and The People's Ebook, or authoring/sharing apps such as KYUR8 <!--pia: Why? what do these do??-->

- Use Liz Castro's recipe for turning an artists'/designer's tumblr into downloadable artists' ebooks <!--Pia: Liz castro's receipe is unclear, what is this where can it be found? -->

- Media artist approach: experiment with computer/server-generated epub, using collage/cut-up methods, generative or appropriation art recipe (similar to the Yes Men's "Ream Weaver" web site mirroring tool)

- Pirate site approach: easy conversions of publications into ebooks, emphasis on spreading, and alternative ways of networking (such as person-to-person USB stick file exchange.

- Since the artists' book is not a defined genre, any methodology / workflow that can be thought of

How to make an arts/design periodical in EPUB2/3, HTML5 (/app), PDF

A step-by-step guide

Advantages, disadvantages

<!--Florian's text:-->

Lately, artists' and designer's books have grown from a niche phenomenon to a major genre within arts and design publishing. It could be argued that the book as an art or design object in its own right has become more prominent now that the function of the book as a generic carrier of information (such as in a telephone directory, a dictionary or a run-of-the-mill novel or non-fiction paperback) is increasingly taken over by the World Wide Web and by ereaders. 


#### Transfer from paper to electronic?

The more medium-specific an artist's book is, the less sense it makes to translate it 1:1 into an electronic book. Dieter Roth's sculptural book objects <!--Pia: insert footnote-->, for example, would change from book art works to mere depictions of book art works when reproduced electronically. 

On the other hand, many contemporary artists, designers and media activists experimented with electronic publishing as a 'poor' (i.e. simple low tech) medium of social sharing rather than a 'rich' visual and tactile medium:

* In the 1980s and early 1990s, many makers of zines (do-it-yourself small press periodicals) became makers of _e-zines_, electronic zines that used dial-up computer bulletin boards and the Internet as noncommercial samizdat media. Their typical publication format were simple plain text files.[^e-zines] Many e-zines worked around their technical limitations by using ASCII art, typograms as they had also been produced in 1960s and 70s concrete poetry on typewriters, and with homebrew formatting codes ('_' for underlines, '#' for headlines etc.), the immediate precursors of the Markdown format described here in this toolkit.
* In the early 1990s, there also existed a hacker culture of 'disk mags' for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST home computers. These electronic magazines were anonymously published on floppy disks and were based on self-written computer programs (factually, early 'apps') that displayed their animated text and visual contents.
* Since the late 1990s, there have been a number of artist-run sites * textz.com, ubu.com, aaaaarg.org, monoskop.org - that offer free downloads of cultural theory and arts-related books, typically in simple formats such as plain text, PDF and EPUB.
In these examples, the focus is not on the book as a visual object, but on concepts and politics of its sharing and dissemination; in other words, artists' publishing as electronic samizdat. In such scenarios, artists' publishing as simple 1:1 transfers from print originals to electronic reproductions can make sense.

##### Technical solutions for samizdat publications <!--Pia: introduce term samizdat pls -->

For such activist or minimalist projects, the lowest technical denominator and most easily readable file formats are advisable:

* plain text (ASCII) as the most simple, compatible and minimalist solution
* single-file HTML. It is possible to directly embed images into an HTML file (without providing them as separate files); technical instructions can be found [here](...). <!--Amy: empty link! -->
* PDF. This format is widely readable and best suited for faithfully reproducing print books, but limited in its readability on different devices and hardly editable (more explanation [here](...)).<!--Amy: empty link! -->
* EPUB. This format is factually just HTML for offline reading, with improved publication meta data and improved compatibility to ereaders. Projects can very easily be made and provided both in HTML and EPUB.
Since the design of most samizdat books does not differ from that of [research publications](#Research publication) or other visually simple publishing formats, no special design advice is necessary here, except the principle of 'worse is better': the smaller the file size, the most compatible and universally readable the file format, the better, even if this comes at the expense of typographic and visual quality. An plain text files, then, might be preferable to a nicely designed PDF file. <!-- Silvio suggests also to focus on the technical solution for  sharing texts, like etherpad, textb.org -->

#### How to make visually oriented artists' books

##### Pre-history and general issues

There is, factually, a rich tradition of artists' audiovisual electronic books: It began in the 1990s with hypertext and interactive multimedia literary experiments on floppy disk, CD-ROMs, later web sites and mobile apps. The Electronic Literature Organization[^electronic-literature-organization] and the international research project ELMCIP[^elmcip] document it extensively. Much of this documentation has become media archeology since multimedia formats have become obsolete: CD-ROM applications that no longer run on contemporary computers, websites whose links or plug-ins are no longer working or not compatible to today's browsers anymore. 

This problem was greater in the 1990s and early 2000s when working open, cross-platform multimedia standards barely existed. But even today, the rule explained in chapter ... <!-- cross-reference to Arjen's overview graph of non-visual vs. visual epublishing technologies--> still applies: The more complex the audiovisuality of an electronic book, the less compatible it will be to all kinds of different electronic reading devices, and the more technical updates it will likely need over the course of time. <!-- Silvio: This problem was also exemplified by the massive use of Flash by e-lit artists --> 

##### Simple solutions

Electronic visual books can be made in very simple ways:

* As a sequence of images, embedded into an EPUB file <!-- add reference-->, a self-contained HTML file <!-- add reference--> or a PDF file.
* As a PDF file. This is generally the most easy-to-use straightforward format for visual publications in a universally working format. However, for long-time durability, the PDF/A format is preferable to run-of-the mill PDF.[^PDF/A]  PDF documents can be graphically designed to work on different screen sizes, and resolution of embedded visuals can be decreased to keep the file size friendly for downloading. Still, the format is essentially limited to fixed document sizes and remains an electronic representation of printed matter. 
* Other standard file formats creatively (ab)used as document formats for visual books: animated GIF graphics files for the digital equivalent of flip books, for example, **mp4** video files displaying a real-time book, mp3 audio files triggering abstract art on the volume meter display of an audio player, JPEG files with encoding artefacts of corrupted bits.[^other-formats] <!-- should this be mentioned as simple? not all of these formats work on e-readers. mention reference to image of Arjen or overview of strengths and weaknesses -->
* Self-contained HTML. <!-- explain the use of self-contained HTML with base64-->

## Art/design periodical

- Art OPEN Magazine of e-Flux journal, advise to use the web, instead of EPUB. 

- Non-commericial website / PDF 

- Academic magazine (jStor) 

- Public Magazine 

- Commercial / app store model. <!--1000 words -->

### General
![Periodical Approach](images/08_WorkflowPeriodical.png "Periodical Digital Approaches") 

<!-- Image: very rough sketch -->

(a) magazine as downloadable PDF file; 

(b) magazine as PDF-based app in a tablet, via commercial app platform (such as Scribd or Issuu) or PDF-to-app software. Low-cost solution with a traditional revenue model (in-app purchase). Commercial authoring solution: Woodwing.

(c) magazine as HTML5-based publication in a platform app. Commercial distribution platform solution: Blendle.

(d) magazine as self-published website. Best solution: CMS like WordPress, with custom design template. Most independent magazines work this way, but revenue model is difficult. Additional technical benefit: structured database of everything ever published on the site, easy to use as a basis for exporting to custom publications (downloadable e-books, InDesign layout for print yearbooks - see Elizabeth Castro's chapter - etc.)


### Decision making
Should it be a 1:1 transfer from paper book to e-journal? There are now gradual transitions from traditional to new workflows in digital magazine publishing which break up the old-vs-new dichotomy. On this scale, providing a magazine as a downloadable PDF file is the most traditional solution, and turning the magazine into a website (running on a content management systems such as WordPress) the least traditional. On the upside, all these technical solutions are now mature thanks to 20 years of online news publishing.

### Instructions
See above. 

### Specific issues for this publication type
The main issue is to which extent the integrity of the publication as _one_ medium is important, or whether to entirely give up the traditional system of periodical appearance in bundled issues. Alternatively, the model could be (a) a continuously updated web site (similar to a news website or a blog), (b) focus on providing single articles rather than bundled issues based on search engine hits, social media recommendations etc. In the end, there is no hard difference between a "blog" and a "magazine" online.

### Based on the above, what to choose?

How to make an arts/design periodical in epub2/3, HTML5 (/app), PDF

A step-by-step guide

Advantages, disadvantages:

- epub2/3 is, at the moment, an esoteric choice for a magazine and would be rather an option for scholarly journals. However, if cleverly used, it can combine advantages of PDF (single file distribution) with HTML (responsive design, small file sizes, modularity/reusability, automation).
- HTML5: theoretically ideal, gets increasingly used for multimedia journalism (following the example of the "Snow Fall" reportage by the New York Times from December 2012. Problem of design complexity when making 'responsive' design pages.
- PDF: easiest to integrate in existing workflows, disadvantage: clumsy, non-responsive, high file size, meant for print.
