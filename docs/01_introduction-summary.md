- Hybrid print and electronic publishing requires new work methods and workflows.
- Low budget, small edition, in-house designed, visually-oriented publications require more change in work methods than big budget publications whose ebook design can be outsourced.
- Interactive multimedia is still difficult to realize in books. All the while, new opportunities lie in entirely new publication formats (like: books with customized content, micro books).
- This Toolkit focuses on low budget, in-house-designed, hybrid print and electronic books made with standard software and Open Source tools.
