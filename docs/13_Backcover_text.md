# Back cover text
Electronic publishing has become a vital part of contemporary arts and design. Periodicals like the _e-flux journal_, art and design blogs, Internet libraries like _Ubu Web_ are widely read and discussed. 

At the same time, traditional models of art book publishing become less and less viable. To which extent - and how - can artists, writers, designers and publishers use electronic book technology as an alternative? And what needs to be done for print and electronic editions of the same publication? 

This guide is meant for everyone working in art and design publishing - and presupposes no digital technology expertise. It contains hands-on practical advice and tools, focusing on working solutions for low-budget, small edition publishing. 

Everything in the Hybrid Publishing Toolkit is based on real-world projects with art and design publishers. Editorial scenarios include catalogues, research publications and artists' books.
