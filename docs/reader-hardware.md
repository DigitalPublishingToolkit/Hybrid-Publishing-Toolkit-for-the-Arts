##Reader Hardware##
There are several ways to peruse electronic publications. Portable devices like e-readers or tablets are by far the most popular gateway to digital content. Smartphones also offer some of the capabilities of an e-reader, as most of these devices are a miniature version of their tablet counterparts.


####e-Readers###
e-Readers became widely known by the introduction of Amazon Kindle in 2007. e-Readers differ from tablets in the way that they are really only suitable for reading books, are relatively cheap and have monochrome displays. An important characteristic of the e-reader is the use of *electronic paper* (e-paper), a so-called electrophoretic screen. Electronic paper is designed to mimic the characteristics of paper as close as possible and is relatively low on energy consumption.

Both Amazon and Barnes & Noble also offer more expensive models, Kindle Fire (and Kindle Fire HD) and NOOK Tablet (and NOOK HD+) respectively. These models are not really e-readers anymore, but fully-fledged, small sized tablets. These models do not use *e-paper*, but colour LED screens with backlight â€“ a standard component of tablets like iPad or Galaxy Tab. Mostly these tablets use a version of the Android operating system as its core, in contrast to the classic monochromatic e-readers using their own operating system built on a version of Linux. The Samsung Galaxy Note and Apple iPad mini can be seen as an answer to these smaller sized tablets.

Because of the lack of a colour screen the current generation of e-readers is best suited for text-based publications, i.e. novels, etc. 


###Tablets###
The tablet-market is dominated by two main players,[^sales-figures-tablet] Apple and Samsung. Apple utilises their own operating system (iOS) for the iPad, while Samsung with its Galaxy Tab product line has opted for Android, albeit heavily modified from the base, open source version of the OS. The Android-segment of the market consists of many manufacturers offering similar hardware with a variant of Android as its operating system. Several e-reading applications exist for both iOS and Android, the most important ones will be reviewed in [the Reader Software](reader-software.html) section of the toolkit.

The most important advantage of tablets over traditional e-readers is the fact that the latter doesn't support colour. The upside of the tablet's colour screen is at the same time also a weakness, as backlit LED screens are generally supposed to induce eye fatigue. Reading in the sun is problematic as well, because direct sunlight obscures most of the visibility of <!-- is there something missing here? e.g ""the screen" or full stop? --> Battery life is another issue with tablets. Though newer tablet models often claim impressive battery life hours, e-readers still reign supreme with an average battery life of up to several weeks.

###Smartphone###
The story for tablets also largely applies to the realm of smartphones.[^sales-figures-phone] Of course most smartphones sport smaller screens than both e-readers and tablets. But the similarities between smartphones and tablets are large enough to justify clustering them with tablet devices. 

###PC/Laptop###
Reading e-books on a laptop or personal computer is of course a possibility but may be a less natural fit than handheld devices. A full range of software for e-reading is available, but the same downsides of relatively limited battery life and increased chances of eye fatigue exist as with tablets.
