Markdown is nothing but plain, unformatted text with human-readable formatting symbols. For example, this is what the beginning of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" would like in Markdown:

    # Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
    
    ## Chapter I. Down the Rabbit-Hole

    There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
    it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,

    > Oh dear! Oh dear! 
    > I shall be late!

    (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she
    ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
    natural); but when the Rabbit actually **took a watch out of its
    waistcoat-pocket**, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice
    started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
    never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
    watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across
    the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
    down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

"#" signifies a top-level headline, "##" a second-level headline, "_" italic text, "**" bold text, "> " a long quote. Beyond that, Markdown provides conventions for marking up bold text, lists, embedded images, links. Its popular extension MultiMarkdown also supports footnotes, tables, mathematical formulas, cross-references, bibliographies and definition lists. With simple Open Source converter programs, Markdown text like the above can be automatically translated into well-structured HTML, ePub, PDF, RTF (for importing into InDesign) and other document formats, with a single mouse click or keyboard command, requiring no manual adjustments.

Markdown is a child of Internet culture. It standardizes ad-hoc formatting signs used in E-Mail and chats, and became popular in blogging software. There are similar plain text formatting languages to Markdown: the Wiki syntax used in Wikipedia, the language _Textile_ that is used for a number of web content management systems and the language _reStructuredText_ used for writing technical manuals, and many others. 

 Markdown & Co. are human-readable, human-friendly well-structured document formats, excellent for long-term storage and as the basis (or source code) for conversions into present and future document formats. While they are simple, they are also strict and unambiguous enough in their formatting syntax that multiple writers and editors can work on a document without introducing weirdness into its formatting. Another advantage: Markdown can be written an edited on any text program, even as E-Mail or in an web browser or on a mobile phone. Unlike Word or other classical word processing programs, it is not bound to specific software (just like in graphics, the JPEG format is not dependent on any particular piece of software, but can be edited in any graphics program). 

Why do we recommend Markdown in particular? For particular publishing projects - for example, handbooks or books derived from Wikis -, it can be worth considering one the alternatives to Markdown such as _reStructuredText_. (It's also quite easy to convert those into Markdown and vice versa.) There are, however, two reasons why we recommend Markdown as a practical tool for electronic and mixed media publishing:

1. Excellent software support. As the most popular human-readable plain text formatting language, there is plethora of available user-friendly, high quality software for writing and editing documents in Markdown and for converting it into other formats. While Markdown can be written and edited in any computer program that allows to edit text, there are a number of very user-friendly text programs that make it easier to write and view.

2. With Multimarkdown (an extended version of Markdown), it provides all the necessary formatting and document syntax needed in arts- and humanities-oriented text publishing. It is perfectly possible to write, for example, a cultural studies Ph.D. thesis in Multimarkdown, or the essay part (complete with footnotes and bibliographical references) of an exhibition catalog.

Markdown/MultiMarkdown is however not a magic one-size-fits-all solution. It is excellent for text-heavy editorial work, but limited for visual document creation and not really usable for interactive publishing formats. It is not a layout tool, but a pure manuscript format, excellent for keeping manuscripts in a well-structured, readable, durable, software-independent format. 

Markdown (and similar formatting/markup language) are meant for workflows in which there is a clear separation between editorial work - involving writers, translators and editors - on the one hand and publication design on the other. For publications where there is a high degree of interaction between writers/editors and visual designers/artists from the very beginning of the authoring process, these document languages are not the right tool.
