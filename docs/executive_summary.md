# Executive summary

"You must change your life" - borrowing from philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, this is our burdensome message for arts- and design-oriented publishers, writers, editors and designers wanting to transition towards electronic publishing or, more typically, towards hybrid print and electronic publishing. If electronic publishing will merely remain an afterthought in your production chain and product portfolio, this change can be light. If electronic publishing will become just as important as print, it can be radical.

The transition will require a rethinking of traditional publication formats, a rethinking of editorial and production workflows, and last but not least a rethinking of distribution. 

This rethinking will even be necessary if your publication won't drastically change its form and content in the electronic medium. For arts and design publications, the challenge of going electronic can be even greater than for other fields of publishing for a number of reasons: 
- visually oriented publications are still more difficult to technically realize in the electronic medium when designing for a multitude of different reading devices and platforms;
- small publishers are under even higher pressures to keep projects within reasonable costs;
- small editions make it necessary that electronic publications are sustainable:  they should not need constant investment into technical maintenance and version updates.

These factors often amount to a huge contrast between computer industry promises and the reality of the new medium. On the one hand, publishers, editors, designers and artists overestimate interactive and multimedia opportunities of electronic publishing. These possibilities do exist, but tend be more expensive and specific to particular technical reading platforms. On the other hand, publishers often underestimate how even technically simple and seemingly banal types of electronic publications can force a rethinking of traditional publishing formats (such as: the anthology, the catalogue, the periodical). Rethought formats may be the greatest opportunity offered by electronic publishing: for example, splitting up a traditional exhibition catalogue into micro monographs that people can download and read as individual e-books.

Going electronic - or going hybrid - also means that you need to change the way you work in the whole process from manuscript to publication. The software tools currently in use, from word processors like Microsoft Word to desktop publishing suites like InDesign, were created for the analog world. Although it's possible to create electronic publications from those Word and InDesign files that are likely the standard in your publishing workflow, it will be painful, slow, inefficient and expensive in most cases. This Toolkit describes technical alternaives because it is primarily aimed at low-budget publishers <!--it is not really only about the budget right?-- > who do not outsource e-book design to external service providers. It describes easy-to-use tools and work methods for editing and designing hybrid print and electronic publications for everyone - publishing houses, editors, writers, designers and artists. 

This toolkit has a particular (but not exclusive) focus on epub as an electronic publication format and on Markdown as a word processing format because of the specific needs of small edition publishers in the arts and design field: low cost, ease of use, sustainability, platform-independence. These recommendations result from our practical experience in collaborating with four Dutch art, design and research publishers on electronic publication projects.
