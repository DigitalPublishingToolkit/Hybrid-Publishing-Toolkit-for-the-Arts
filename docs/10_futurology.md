# Futurology

Where will e-publishing be in 2020?




## Reading technology 

Advantages and disadvantages will remain the same: affordability and portability of whole libraries vs. independence from electricity and visual-tacticle advantages of paper books.

Improvement of e-paper: color e-paper, flexible e-paper

4K displays for mobile devices will push display resolution

possible anti-cloud/anti-obsolescence backlash

## Reading culture 

Mainstream of publishing will remain in traditional textual formats. Reader technology is now good enough to allow pleasant on-screen reading.

Foreseeable: generic forms of publication (such as the paperback) will slowly migrate to electronic, paper publishing will become more visually and tactile oriented. 



## Publishing culture

Likely: switch from individual product retail to rental/subscription model. Subscription to complete libraries with unlimited access to media within the rental period. (Examples: Netflix, Spotify, Adobe Creative Cloud, JSTOR).
