# 10 Futurology

Where will e-publishing be in 2020?
<!--Miriam jotted in notes and links-->

## Reading technology 

Both hardware / software

There is an increase in reading on the smartphone. Some speculate that e-readers will be obsolete. <!-- A confirmation of this might be the fact that the sony ereader, one of the most appreciated ones, is not produced anymore -->

Books as apps - blurred lines between books / websites / apps

Advantages and disadvantages will remain the same: affordability and portability of whole libraries vs. independence from electricity and visual-tacticle advantages of paper books.

Improvement of e-paper: color e-paper, flexible e-paper

4K displays for mobile devices will push display resolution <!--just read this comment elsewhere: '4K is all the buzz today, but clearly 16K is on the horizon' ^Miriam-->

possible anti-cloud/anti-obsolescence backlash - for example in the creation and maintenance of personal 

## Reading culture 

Mainstream of publishing will remain in traditional textual formats. Reader technology is now good enough to allow pleasant on-screen reading.

Foreseeable: generic forms of publication (such as the paperback) will slowly migrate to electronic, paper publishing will become more visually and tactile oriented. 

Something about the much discussed 'change' in reading - deep versus shallow reading (Nicholas Carr). But is it so? See for example: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/53d3096a-f792-11e3-90fa-00144feabdc0.html#axzz374aeWjXN Two things are notable in this. First, paper might simply be a cultural preference, and e-readers something we just have to get used to using in a good way. Second, the 'preference' for deep reading might as well be relative. For an active working with the text (for interpretation and learning for example) skimming, adding notes, looking up background information et cetera might work better than immersive, deep reading. And e-readers, tablets, and phones might be better suited for that purpose.

Other ways of dealing with texts open up, allowing a more interactive relationship between reader and text.Not only in the sense of adding audio and video, but also leaving the reader the choice of entry into the text, setting out an individual reader path per person. See for example http://futureofthebook.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Tether_Mise-en-Page_FINAL.pdf

<!-- Texts will be more and more influenced by reading statistics, see Popular Highlights on Kindle, or quantification of reading habits on Scribd and Oyster -->

## Publishing culture

Likely: switch from individual product retail to rental/subscription model. Subscription to complete libraries with unlimited access to media within the rental period. (Examples: Netflix, Spotify, Adobe Creative Cloud, JSTOR).  <!-- Is the subscription model working in music? -->

Writers / artists / designers who self-publish will increase

Amazon spreading, also causing chances for idependent publishers?

Blurring lines between media company / publisher / writer. What is the added value of a publisher? What distinguishes the publisher from those other companies or independent one-man-publishers? How will publishers redefine their expertise? (http://www.litragger.com/literature-news/commentary/5-myths-about-the-new-era-of-publishing/)

Publishing becoming a function rather than an industry: http://www.idealog.com/blog/atomization-publishing-as-a-function-rather-than-an-industry/



###NOTES / IDEAS
<!-- By Joost-->
Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be), is the never ending question
for electronic publishing of art books as well. In art books we try to
describe, show, analyse and collect works of art. These works can be
made of everything, but more often than not they deal with tactile
objects, paintings, drawings, sculptures, etc, etc. In many books these
works are reproduced and discussed. But writing itself is also an art
form and the mutual interaction between texts and tactile objects
becomes more and more integrated. In the 20s and 30s of the previous
century collages became very popular. Here texts, newspaper clippings,
photographs and any other expressions, mostly on a paper substrate were
put together to obtain a new artwork. In an electronic environment we
transcend this collage technique into a new substrate. But now enormous
range of novel opportunities for creative expression becomes possible.
As we showed above in this booklet, gluing, dissecting and endless
reorganising enables us to create new works that can express themselves
differently in different technological environments as well as tailored
to the readersâ€™s desire of the moment of consumption. Electronic
publishing becomes like a gigantic fruit salad bar, where the end user
is able to or fill her own plate or to make a choice between prepared
combinations. This not the same as blending all ingredients into one
smoothie, which is an end phase from where no way back is possible.
