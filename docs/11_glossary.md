# 11 Glossary of Technical Terms

### A

#####Acronym
An acronym is a shortened version of a phrase, often taking the first letters. For example, GIGO is the acronym for 'Garbage in garbage out' or WYSIWYG, otherwise known as 'What you see is what you get'. 

<!-- not in text (Miriam)#####Adware
Any software which serves banner ads or pop-up ads to you while in use. It is sometimes installed in freeware or shareware which you download from the internet, and provides one more channel for advertisers to reach you. Some adware will also track your files, net usage, and software and report it back to advertisers to help them channel relevant ads to you.  -->

<!-- not in text (Miriam)#####Aliasing, anti-aliasing
Pictures on your computer monitor are made up of square pixels. When the edge of a solid colored object in a GIF image is a diagonal or curved line, and it is displayed against a contrasting color, the edges appear jagged, like stair steps. This jagged appearance is called aliasing. The jagged appearance can be softened by filling in adjacent pixels with intermediate colors between the object and the background. This softening of the edges is called anti-aliasing. Software like Photoshop can apply anti-aliasing for you automatically. One problem with anti-aliasing GIF images is that it increases the number of colors used, necessarily increasing the file size. You must decide whether quick loading or smoothed edges serves your needs better.-->

<!-- not in text & incomplete  (Miriam)#####Algorithm
This is the name given to a 'defined set of steps that can be used to complete a task'. For example there are algorithms worked out for sorting a list efficiently. A computer programmer can buy a book of algorithms so they not need to re-invent the wheel when they have to code for a job that has already been worked out. Having bought the book, they would look up the problem of 'How to sort a list' and a good book would tell them a number of ways to do this. Algorithms are not computer code,-->

#####Android
An open source operating system targeted at mobile phones and tablets. It's based on a Linux kernel and Java programming language. As a mobile operating system Android is the most widely used.

#####Amazon

<!-- not in text (Miriam)#####AVI (Audio Video Interleaved)
A Microsoft video format where audio and video coding appears in alternate segments. -->

### B

#####Bandwidth
Literally, the frequency width of a transmission channel in Hertz, kiloHertz, megaHertz, etc. Often used as an expression of the amount of data that can be sent through a circuit. The greater the bandwidth, the greater the amount of data that can travel in a given time period.

<!-- not in text (Miriam)#####Baud
Rate of transmission speed in a signal - the number of changes of state, such as voltage or frequency, per second in a signal. Named for the French teleprinter inventor Baudot. In simplest systems, it is synonymous with bits per second. In more complex systems, a baud may include more than one bit.-->

#####Binary
A number system used in computing, based on a representation for numbers with only two digits (0 and 1). Computers use this because they can only recognize these two values, 1 or 0. This is simulated electronically by using a device, such as a switch, which is either on (1) or off (0). All numbers are represented by combinations of ones and zeroes, thus the number 9 is represented as 1001.

#####Bit
Contraction of *binary digit*. A bit is the smallest measurement unit of computer memory or data transmission speed.

<!-- not in text (Miriam)#####Bitmap (BMT)
A computer graphic which is defined by specifying the colors of dots or pixels which make up the picture. Also known as raster graphics. Common types of bitmap graphics are GIF, JPEG, Photoshop, PCX, TIFF, Macintosh Paint, Microsoft Paint, BMP, PNG, FAX formats, and TGA. The file extention is .BMT.-->

#####Blog
Short for web log; usually a chronological record of thoughts, links, events, or actions posted on the web.

#####Browser
Software that will load and display a web page. A browser interprets the HTML or XML code from the web page files, executes embedded scripts and programs, provides encryption/decryption for security where needed, displays graphics, plays music and video, and provides links to related pages. Browsers are based on standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. The major browser software developers participate in these standards, but each of them also builds in their own proprietary codes, whether or not they are approved; differences which create a challenge for web page developers.

#####Browser extension
Plugins to extend or enhance the inner-workings of a web browser.

#####Byte
A measurement of computer memory or disc capacity. A byte comprises 8 *bits*.

### C

<!-- not in text (Miriam)#####CAD/CAM

CAD enables the user to manipulate drawings, including 3D drawings, and viewing them from a variety of angles. CAM is a general term for computer support during the manufacturing process.-->

#####Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
Cascading Style Sheets are a feature that enables a range of styles for headers, body text, bullet points, links etc., to be specified for hypertext documents (HTML and XML, so also EPUB). This makes it possible to set up CSS file containing a library of styles that are used throughout a website or publication, thereby facilitating consistency. If a style needs to be changed throughout a website it only needs to be changed once in the CSS file and then it will be applied automatically.

#####Compatiblity
Pieces of hardware and/or software which are capable of being used together are described as *compatible*.

#####Compressed files
Compression is a technique to make a file or a data stream smaller for faster transmission or to take up less storage space. An example is EPUB, a compressed collection of HTML files. Several programs will compress and decompress files, such as PKZIP, WinZip, Stuffit, gnu zip, and many more. Files with the following extensions are almost always compressed files: arc, arj, epub, gz, lha, lhz, taZ, taz, tgz, Z, zip, and zoo. 

#####Computer program
A set of instructions that the computer carries out in sequence to perform a given task. Programs are written in English-like programming languages (e.g. C, Pascal, JAVA, C++) , and are then converted into binary machine instructions via a compiler or an interpreter.

#####Content management system (CMS)
A software package that makes it possible for non-technical users to publish and manage content (text, images, etc) on a website.

<!-- not in text (Miriam)#####Cookie
A cookie is a short file put on your system by a web page when you visit a website for  the first time. It includes information about your usage and facilitates the current interaction. For example, it may include the information that you have logged into a passworded area already in the current session and don't need a second password check. There are many uses for cookies, they may be erased at the end of a session or retained until the next session, and they may be encrypted or in plain text. If retained, the next time that the user visits that site, the information in the cookie is sent back to the site so that the site can tailor what it presents to the user, e.g. tastes in music or shopping habits.-->

### D

#####Data
Strictly speaking the plural of 'datum', but now usually considered as a collective noun in the singular, with the plural form 'data items' or 'items of data'. Data is information in a form which can be processed by a computer. It is usually distinguished from a *computer program*, which is a set of instructions that a computer carries out. Data can be text or sets of figures on which a computer program operates.

#####Database

#####Device
An electronic handheld device like a smartphone, tablet, phablet, personal digital assitant (PDA) or portable gaming device (PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Vita).

#####Digital Rights Management (DRM)
Technology used by digital publishers to control the usage of copyright protected material. The practice is controversial as it often hampers paying customers in freely interacting with digital goods (MP3, EPUB, games, etc.). Transferring items with DRM to other devices or using them without an active internet connection often proves to be difficult.

#####Directory
A location on a disc containing *files* and *subdirectories* grouped together for organisational purposes. The term is used synonymously with 'folder', which has become a more common term since the introduction of Windows. Subdirectories are sometimes referred to as 'child directories' of the 'parent directory'. The topmost directory on a computer, which is the parent of all directories on the disc, is known as the 'root directory' and usually has the pathname C:\\\\<!-- Double \ used to espace meta value of \ in Mardown and display C:\\ literaly  -->

<!-- not in text (Miriam)#####Dithering

An older type of printer that works by firing sets of pins in different combinations at an ink ribbon located against a sheet of paper. Such printers produce text that looks 'ragged'. Laser printers and ink-jet printers are now much more common.-->

#####Dots per inch (DPI)
A measure of the quality of output, i.e. the number of dots per square inch produced by a printer or scanner, also referred to as its resolution. A resolution of at least 300 dpi is considered reasonable for the production of high-quality output by a printer and 1200 dpi by a scanner, but modern printers and scanners can produce many more dots per square inch. The resolution of a scanner may also be expressed by two numbers. These are mostly the same, e.g. 1200 x 1200, but you may also see 1200 x 2400, which means that the number of horizontal dots is different from the number of vertical dots.

### E

#####Ebook

#####File
'File' can be used to describe many different things: a computer program, a document file created with a word processor, an image file, an audio file, a video file, etc. A file has a name that describes what it is, and is stored in a certain place.

#####File extension
A method used by many operating systems including Windows and Mac OS is to determine the format of a file based on the end of its name: the letters following the final period. This portion of the filename is known as the filename extension. For example, HTML documents are identified by names that end with .html (or .htm), and GIF images by .gif. In the past names were limited to an eight-character identifier and a three-character extension. There are only a limited number of three-letter extensions, so a given extension might be linked to more than one program. Many formats still use three-character extensions even though modern operating systems and application programs no longer have this limitation. There is no standard list of extensions.

#####File format
A file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. It specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium. File formats may be either proprietary or free and may be either unpublished or open. A specific file format demands specific programs to read.

<!-- not in text (Miriam)#####File permissions
Files stored on a computer usually have *permissions* governing which users are allowed to read, amend or execute them. This is particularly important in a school, college or university network environment, where teachers and lecturers may have the permission to amend certain files, e.g. documents that they have created, but students are only allowed to read them. File permissions are usually determined by network managers.-->

#####Formatting
The process of applying styling (bold, italic, etc.) to sentences and paragraphs. Another meaning can be: the process of preparing a writeable disc for use. 

#####Freemium
A revenue model whereby the base product is free of charge, but can be extended with paid options or plugins.

### G

#####Graphic Interchange Format (GIF)
A file format used for storing simple graphics. GIF files use a palette of 256 colours, which makes them practical for almost all graphics except photographs. Generally, GIF files should be used for logos, line drawings, icons, etc, i.e. images that don't contain a rich range of colours. A GIF file containing a small number of colours tends to be quite small, but it will be big if the image has a wide range of colours. GIF files are commonly used for storing images on the Web and are also suitable for storing animated (moving) images.

#####GitHub
A digital platform for collaboration, code review, and code management for open source and private projects.

<!-- not in text (Miriam)#####Graphical User Interface (GUI)

#####HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
The transfer method (protocol) used by the World Wide Web to transmit and receive Web pages.

#####Hyperlink
A contraction of hypertext link, the essence of hypertext and the HTML language used for creating pages on the World Wide Web. In a Web document a hyperlink can be a sequence of letters or an image leading to another part of the page, a different page on the same website, or to a completely different website when clicked upon.

#####Hypertext
A system for the non-sequential presentation of text, the fundamental concept of the World Wide Web, whereby the user can jump from one part of a text to another, from one Web page to another, or from one website to another, by clicking on highlighted (and usually underlined) hyperlinks. The concept of hypertext predates the Web by many years.

There are also software interfaces that enable one program to link with another, passing across data and variables. The term interface, also known as user interface, also describes the software that is used to enable human beings to communicate with a computer.

#####Internet
The internet, or simply 'the Net', is a computer network connecting millions of computers all over the world. It provides communications to governments, businesses, universities, schools, and homes. Any modern computer can be connected to the internet using existing communications systems. Schools and universities normally access the internet via their own educational networks, but private individuals usually have to take out a subscription with an service provider. Although the internet is in fact a network of networks, it appears to users as a network of individual computers. The internet dates back to the group of interconnected networks that evolved from the ARPANET of the late 60s and early 70s. It has grown from a handful of interconnected networks into a huge network of millions of computers.

#####iOS

<!-- not in text (Miriam)*AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML)*
A popular technology closely linked with JavaScript, used to update details on a web page without having to fully refresh it.

jQuery
JavaScript library providing a set of convenience methods for programmers in order to dynamically manipulate webpages.-->

#####JPEG or JPG (Joint Photographic Expert Group)
A file format used for storing images. The JPEG/JPG format uses a palette of millions of colours and is primarily intended for photographic images. The internal compression algorithm of the JPEG/JPG format, unlike the GIF format, actually throws out superfluous information, which is why JPEG/JPG files containing photographic images end up smaller than GIF files containing photographic images.

### K

A macro is a series of commands and instructions that you group together as a single command to accomplish a task automatically. Instead of manually performing a series of time-consuming, repetitive actions, you can create and run a single macro - in effect, a custom command that carries out the task for you. A macro can be saved and called up whenever you need it.-->

#####Mark-up Language

Businesses and educational institutions often use PDF-formatted files to display the original look of their brochures or for publishing a complete magazine in electronic format. Using the full Adobe Acrobat software package, it is possible to create a high-quality piece of artwork or a brochure which preserves the look of the original, complete with fonts, colors, images, and formatting. Documents in PDF format can be published on the Web without having to be converted into HTML, but are static and thus not reflowable.

#####Pixel

#####Print-on-demand (POD)
Print on demand (POD) is a digital printing technology in which a book or other publication is printed in the amount one needs it. The POD model in this sense deviates from traditional printing, where large quantities of books are produced in initial print runs to reduce costs prior to distribution. POD has also changed the publishing industry by reducing the need for traditional publishing houses, allowing authors to self-publish at very low costs. Print-on-demand is sometimes called publish-on-demand.

#####Program
A computer program is a set of instructions for a computer, allowing it to performing certain tasks.
<!-- The American spelling is standard in computer jargon, enabling a useful distinction to be made in British English between a *computer program* and a *programme* in the sense of a *programme of study*. A talk with the title "Turning programmes into programs" (or maybe it was the other way round) was presented by a British Council officer at the annual TESOL conference in the USA in 1987 - which puzzled the American audience but made sense to the British participants.-->

#####Protocol
In internet terminology protocol usually refers to a set of rules that define an exact format for communication between systems. For example the HTTP protocol defines the format for communication between web browsers and Web server.

### Q

<!-- #####QR code (Quick Response Code)

Instead of writing down the information relating to a website URL or map location etc, you just take a photo of the QR code.-->

<!-- #####QuickTime
Software by Apple used for viewing movies and listening to audio recordings-->

### R

#####Reflowable
A reflowable document is a type of electronic document that can adapt its presentation to the output device.

#####Resolution
A measure of the number of pixels or small dots displayed on a computer display screen, printer or scanner. One normally talks in terms of the quality of resolution, using the expression low-resolution, medium-resolution and high-resolution. The resolution of a computer display screen is normally expressed as two numbers representing the horizontal and vertical resolution, i.e. dots across each line of the screen and down each line of the screen: e.g. 640 x 480, 1024 x 768, etc. The resolution of a printer is normally referred to by the number of dots per inch (dpi) - i.e. square inch.
