# 11 Glossary of Technical Terms

### A

#####Acronym
An acronym is a shortened version of a phrase, often taking the first letters. For example, GIGO is the acronym for 'Garbage in Garbage out' or WYSIWYG, otherwise known as 'What you see is what you get'. 

#####Adware
Any software which serves banner ads or pop-up ads to you while in use. It is sometimes installed in freeware or shareware which you download from the nets, and provides one more channel for advertisers to reach you. Some adware will also track your files, net usage, and software and report it back to advertisers to help them channel relevant ads to you. 

#####Aliasing, anti-aliasing
Pictures on your computer monitor are made up of square pixel. When the edge of a solid colored object in a GIF image is a diagonal or curved line, and it is displayed against a contrasting color, the edges appear jagged, like stair steps. This jagged appearance is called aliasing. The jagged appearance can be softened by filling in adjacent pixels with intermediate colors between the object and the background. This softening of the edges is called anti-aliasing. Software like PhotoShop can apply anti-aliasing for you automatically. One problem with anti-aliasing GIF images is that it increases the number of colors used, necessarily increasing the file size. You must decide whether quick loading or smoothed edges serves your needs better.

#####Algorithm
This is the name given to a "defined set of steps that can be used to complete a task". For example there are 'algorithms' worked out for sorting a list efficiently. A computer programmer can buy a book of algorithms so they not need to re-invent the wheel when they have to code for a job that has already been worked out. Having bought the book, they would look up the problem of 'How to sort a list' and a good book would tell them a number of ways to do this. Algorithms are not computer code,

#####Android
An Open Source operating system targeted at mobile phones, tablets. It's based on a Linux kernel and the Java programming language. As a mobile operating system Android is the most widely used.

#####Amazon
Online retailer of various goods, including ebooks, and producer of the Kindle and Fire ereading devices.

#####App
An application (software program) for mobile or desktop operating systems. Mobile apps are often distributed through an app store (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).

#####App store
An online store where mobile applications may be bought or obtained for free. Every major mobile operating system also has its own storefront for mobile apps - App Store (Apple), Google Play, Amazone Store, Windows Phone Store en BlackBerry App World.

#####AZW (Amazon Word)
File format used by the Amazon Kindle e-Book reader.

#####Anchor
An 'anchor' is a specific location within a HTML-web page that can be jumped to by clicking on a hyperlink.

#####Animated GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)
A GIF2 graphic file, which consists of two or more images shown in a timed sequence to give the effect of motion.

#####API (Application Programming Interface)
An interface between the operating system and application programs that specifies how the two communicate with each other. 

#####Applet
An Applet is a small program that is downloaded from a web page and executed by browser software. Also, an HTML tag that defines an applet program which is written in Java and designed to run on a web page. It can be used to display scrolling text such as a marquee across the top of a page or other animations

#####ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
A standard way to encode upper and lower case letters in the English alphabet, numbers, and special characters using only seven bits, and therefore limited to 128 characters.

#####AVI (Audio Video Interleaved)
A Microsoft video format where audio and video coding appears in alternate segments. AVI files will end with an .avi extension.

### **B**

*Bandwidth*
Literally, the frequency width of a transmission channel in Hertz, kiloHertz, megaHertz, etc. Often used as an expression of the amount of data that can be sent through a circuit. The greater the bandwidth, the greater the amount of data that can travel in a given time period.

*Baud*
Rate of transmission speed in a signal - the number of changes of state, such as voltage or frequency, per second in a signal. Named for the French teleprinter inventor Baudot. In simplest systems, it is synonymous with bits per second. In more complex systems, a baud may
include more than one bit.

*Binary*
A number system using base 2 instead of the usual (human) base 10, which is normally referred to as the decimal system. Computers use base 2 because they can only recognise two values, 1 or 0. This is simulated electronically by using a device, such as a switch, which is either on (1) or off (0). All numbers are represented by combinations of ones and zeroes, thus the number 9 is represented as 1001, the right-most column being the units column and the other columns, moving from right to left, being 2, 4, 8.

*Bit*
Contraction of *binary digit*. A bit is the smallest measurement unit of computer memory or data transmission speed.

*Bitmap*
A computer graphic which is defined by specifying the colors of dots or pixels which make up the picture. Also known as raster graphics. Common types of bitmap graphics are GIF, JPEG, Photoshop, PCX, TIFF, Macintosh Paint, Microsoft Paint, BMP, PNG, FAX formats, and TGA. The file extention is .BMT.

*Blog*
Short for web log; usually a chronological record of thoughts, links, events, or actions posted on the web.

*Browser*
Software that will load and display a web page. A browser interprets the HTML or XML code from the web page files, executes embedded scripts and programs, provides encryption/decryption for security where needed, displays graphics (except text-only browsers), plays music and video, and provides links to related pages. Browsers are based on standards
developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. The major browser software developers participate in these standards, but each of them also builds in their own proprietary codes, whether or not they are approved. These differences in browsers create a challenge for web page developers.

*Byte*
A measurement of computer memory or disc capacity. A byte comprises 8 *bits*.

### **C**

*CAD/CAM*
Abbreviations for Camputer Aided Design / Computer Aided Manufacturing. A process of drafting, designing and manufacturing with the aid of acomputer. CAD enables the user to manipulate drawings, including 3D drawings, and viewing them from a variety of angles. CAM is a general term for computer support during the manufacturing process.

[CSS (*Cascading Style Sheets*)](#css)
Cascading Style Sheets are a feature of HTML4 that enables a range of styles for headers, body text, bullet points, links etc., to be specified for hypertext documents. This makes it possible to set up CSS file containing a library of styles that are used throughout a website, thereby facilitating consistency. If a style needs to be changed throughout a website it only needs to be changed once in the CSS file and then it will be applied automatically.

*CMS (Content Management System)*
A software package that makes it possible for non-technical users to publish content (text, images, etc) on a website.

*Compatiblity*
Pieces of hardware and/or software which are capable of being used together are described as *compatible*.

*Compression*
Compression is a technique to make a file or a data stream smaller for faster transmission or to take up less storage space. There a number of programs that will compress files, such as PKZIP, WinZip, Stuffit, gnu zip, and many more. Files with the following extensions are almost always compressed files: arc, arj, gz, lha, lhz, taZ, taz, tgz, Z, zip, and zoo.

*Computer Program*
A set of instructions that the computer carries out in sequence to perform a given task. Programs are written in English-like programming languages (e.g. C, Pascal, JAVA, C++) , and are then converted into binary machine instructions via a compiler or an interpreter.

*Cookie*
A cookie is a short file put on your system by a web page when the user visits a website for  the first time. It includes information about your usage and facilitates the current interaction. For example, it may include the information that you have logged into a passworded area already in the current session and don't need a second password check.
There are many uses for cookies, they may be erased at the end of a session or retained until the next session, and they may be encrypted or in plain text. If retained, the next time that the user visits that site, the information in the cookie is sent back to the site so that the site can tailor what it presents to the user, e.g. tastes in music or shopping habits.

### **D**

*Data*
Strictly speaking the plural of "datum",but now usually considered as a collective noun in the singular, with the plural form "data items" or "items of data". Data is information in a form which can be processed by a computer. It is usually distinguished from a *computer program*, which is a set of instructions that a computer carries out. Data can be text
or sets of figures on which a computer program operates.

*Device*
An electronic handheld device like a smartphone, tablet, phablet, personal digital assitant (pda)or portable gaming device (PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Vita).

*DRM ([Digital Rights Management](id:Digital Rights Management))*
Technology used by digital publishers to control the usage of copyright protected material. The practice is controversial as it often hampers paying customers in freely interacting with digital goods (MP3, EPUB, games, etc.). Transferring items with DRM to other devices or using them without an active Internet connection often proves to be difficult.

*DTP (Desktop Publishing)*
Is the practice of designing printed matter on a personal computer, often using software like Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress.

*Directory*
A location on a disc containing a group of *files*and *subdirectories* grouped together for organisational purposes. The term is used synonymously with Folder, which has become a more common term since the introduction of Windows'. Subdirectories are sometimes referred to as
"child directories" of the "parent directory". The topmost directory on a computer, which is the parent of all directories on the disc, is known as the *root directory* and usually has the *pathname* C:\\\\<!-- Double \ used to espace meta value of \ in Mardown and display C:\\ literaly  -->
*Dithering*
The technique of combining dots of primary colours to give the appearance of intermediate colours. Dots are combined in a square area, known as a *dither matrix,* to simulate a dot of an intermediate colour.

*DOS (Disk Operating System)*
An operating system for desktop PCs developed by Microsoft from 1981 to 1995.

*Dot Matrix Printer*
An older type of printer that works by firing sets of pins in different combinations at an ink ribbon located against a sheet of paper. Such printers produce text that looks "ragged". Laser printers and ink-jet printers are now much more common.

*Dpi (Dots Per Inch)*
A measure of the of the quality of output, i.e. the number of dots per square inchproduced by a *printer* or *scanner*, also referred to as its *resolution*. A resolution of at least 300 dpi is considered reasonable for the production of
high-quality output by a printer and 1200 dpi by a scanner, but modern printers and scanners can produce many more dots per square inch. The resolution of a scanner may also be expressed by two numbers. These are mostly the same, e.g. 1200 x 1200, but you may also see 1200 x 2400, which means that the number of horizontal dots is different from the number of vertical dots

### **E**

*ebook*
A range of digital publications which can be read by ereaders, desktop computers and handheld devices.

*EPUB (Electronic Publication)*
An ebook format developed by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). EPUB has been designed to accommodate reflowable content.

*ereader*
A device capable of reading digital texts in various formats, notably EPUB and AZW.

*E-ink*
Electrophoretic ink, a sytem in whch small particals are electrostatically charged in such a way they can become black or white and remain so. Hence, electricity is in fact only used by refreshing the page, which reduces considerably the power consumption and makes it an ideal technology for long reading. The resolution of the stable screen is very high. A disadvantage is that, like paper, the presentation does not allow motion pictures or animations.

*Encryption*
A system of coding that helps prevent access to private information on computer networks or on the Web.

### **F**

*FAQ*
Abbreviation for Frequently Asked Question(s).

*File*
A *file* in computer jargon can be used to describe many different things. It may be a Computer Program, a document file created with a Word-processor, an image file, an audio file, a video file, etc. Think of it in the same way as you would think of a file in a filing cabinet. A file has a name that describes what it is, and the file is stored in a
place where you can easily find it.

*File extension*
One popular method used by many operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS is to determine the format of a file based on the end of its name—the letters following the final period. This portion of the filename is known as the filename extension. For example, HTML documents are identified by names that end with .html (or .htm), and GIF images by .gif. In the past names were limited to an eight-character identifier and a three-character extension. There are only a limited number of three-letter extensions, so, often any given extension might be linked to more than one program. Many formats still use three-character extensions even though modern operating systems and application programs no longer have this limitation. Since there is no standard list of extensions, more than one format can use the same extension, which can confuse both the operating system and users.

*File format*
A file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. It specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium. File formats may be either proprietary or free and may be either unpublished or open. A specific file format demands specific programs to read.

*File Permissions*
Files stored on a computer usually have *permissions* governing which users are allowed to read, amend or execute them. This is particularly important in a a school, college or university network environment, where teachers and lecturers may have the permission to amend certain files, e.g. documents that they have created, but students are only allowed to read them. File permissions are usually determined by network managers.

*Flat text*
 Text without any visual characteristics, so without bolding, italics, etc.
 
*Formatting*
The process of preparing a writeable disc for use. Formatting creates a structure on the disc which enables it to hold data.

*Freemium*
A revenue model whereby the base product is free of charge, but can be extended with paid options or plugins.

### **G**

*GIF (Graphic Interchange Format)*
A file format used for storing simple graphics. GIF files use a palette of 256 colours, which makes them practical for almost all graphics except photographs. Generally, GIF files should be used for logos, line drawings, icons, etc, i.e. images that don't contain a rich range of colours. A GIF file containing a small number of colours tends to be quite small, but it will be big if the image has a wide range of colours, e.g. a photograph.GIF files are commonly used for storing images on the Web. GIF files are also suitable for storing animated (i.e. moving) images.

*GitHub*
Collaboration platform, code review, and code management for open source and private projects.

*GUI (Graphical User Interface)*
An Interface, i.e. a software package, that enables human beings to control what happens on their computers. A GUI consists of graphical elements known as icons and enables the user to run programs and to carry out other operations such as copying information from one Folder/directory to another, deleting files, etc by clicking on these icons, opening and shutting windows and dragging and dropping with a mouse.

### **H**

*Hexadecimal*
A number system used in computers in which numbers are composed of combinations of 16 digits, using 0-9 then the letters A-F to represent 10-15. Hex allows binary numbers to be expressed in a more compact and comprehensible form. For example, 255 = FF (hex) = 11111111 (binary)

*HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)*
A markup language based on SGML. The coding system used for creating pages on the World Wide Web. HTML enables the author to control how the page appears and to insert Hypertext links within one Web page or to other pages anywhere on the Web.

*HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)*
The transfer method (*protocol*) used by the World Wide Web to transmit and receive Web pages.

*Hyperlink*
A contraction of hypertext link, the essence of Hypertext and the HTML language used for creating pages on the World Wide Web. In a Web document a hyperlink can be a sequence of letters or an image. By clicking on the area designated as a hyperlink by the person who created the Web page, it is possible to jump quickly to another part of the page, a different page on the same website, or to a completely different website.

*Hypertext*
A system for the non-sequential presentation of text, the fundamental concept of the World Wide Web, whereby the user can jump from one part of a text to another, from one Web page to another, or from one website to another, by clicking on highlighted (and usually underlined) hyperlinks. The concept of hypertext predates the Web by many years.

### **I**

*Icon*
A small symbol or picture used in a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The icons on the computer screen represent programs or files, e.g. a picture of a painter's palette might represent a program used for drawing and editing pictures, and a picture of a book with a question mark on its cover might represent the text of a manual or a help file.

*Ink Jet Printer*
A type of Printer that fire little jets of ink at the page in order to form the characters and graphics. One of the commonest forms of printers currently in use and capable of producing high-quality output in black and white and in full colour.

*Interface*
An interface in computer jargon is a connection between two systems. It can be Hardware or Software. It may take the form of a plug, cable or socket, or all three, for example where a Printer or Scanner is connected to a computer, and then it's a hardware interface. There are also software interfaces that enable one program to link with another, passing across data and variables. The term interface, also known as user interface, also describes the software that is used to enable human beings to communicate with a computer.

*Internet*
The Internet, or simply "the Net", is a computer network connecting millions of computers all over the world. It provides communications to governments, businesses, universities, schools and homes. Any modern computer can be connected to the Internet using existing communications systems. Schools and universities normally access the Internet via their own educational networks, but private individuals usually have to take out a subscription with an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Although the Internet is in fact a network of networks, it appears to users as a network of individual computers. The Internet dates back to the group of interconnected networks that evolved from the ARPANET of the late 60's and early 70's. It has grown from a handful of interconnected networks into a huge network of millions of computers.

*iPod*
The name of a portable (mobile) Media Player designed and marketed by Apple.

*IT(C) (Information Technology)*

*JavaScript*
JavaScript is a scripting language originally developed by Netscape mainly for use as code within a web page.

Javascript is very popular for common tasks such as validating data entry forms within a web page before they are submitted to the server. Javascript can also alter the way a page looks by dynamically changing CSS format settings within its page.

*AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML)*
A popular technology closely linked with JavaScript, used to update details on a web page without having to fully refresh it.

jQuery
JavaScript library providing a set of convenience methods for programmers in order to dynamically manipulate webpages.

*JPEG or JPG (Joint Photographic Expert Group)*
Pronounced "Jaypeg". A file format used for storing images. The JPEG/JPG format uses a palette of millions of colours and is primarily intended for photographic images. The internal compression algorithm of the JPEG/JPG format, unlike the GIF format, actually throws out superfluous information, which is why JPEG/JPG files containing photographic images end up smaller than GIF files containing photographic images. If you store an image, say, of a flag containing just three colours in JPEG/JPG format it may end up bigger than a GIF file containing the same image, but not necessarily a lot bigger - it depends on the type and range of colours it contains. JPEG/JPG files containing photographic images are normally smaller than GIF files containing photographic images.

### **K**

*KF8*
KF8 is the latest ebook format used by Amazon for its Kindle hardware. See also AZW.

*Kindle*
Kindle is a set of handheld devices and software capable of reading ebooks, particularly Amazons AZW file format. The Kindle product range is manufactured and developed by Amazon.

### **L**

*LAN (Local Area Network)*
A Network of computers at one site that provides services to other computers connected to it. A LAN is usually limited to an immediate area, for example the floor of a building, a single building or a campus. The most important part of a LAN is the Server that delivers software to the computers (also known as workstations or clients) that are connected to it. The server is usually the most powerful computer in the network Users of computers connected to a LAN can access their own files remotely and exchange information with the server and other users connected to the network. 

*Latex*


*LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)*
A technology used for producing a type of flat panel computer Display Screen, which is replacing the older type of Cathode Ray Tube display screen. A more advanced form of technology for producing flat panel display screens is known as TFT (Thin Film Transistor). LCD and TFT screens are also used in digital cameras and camcorders.

*Linux*
Unix-type Operating System. Linux was originally created by Linus Torvalds with the assistance of developers around the world. The Source Code for Linux is open source and hence freely available to everyone.

### **M**

*Macro*
A sort of mini-program that can be incorporated into other programs, comprising a series of keystrokes that you may wish to use over and over again. A macro is a series of commands and instructions that you group together as a single command to accomplish a task automatically. Instead of manually performing a series of time-consuming, repetitive actions, you can create and run a single macro - in effect, a custom command that carries out the task for you. A macro can be saved and called up whenever you need it.

*Mark-up Language*

*Mashup*
A *mashup* is a Web page that brings together data from two or more Web services and combines the data into a new application with added functionality.

Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or shades of one color. So a monochromatic object or image has only colors in shades of limited colors or hues.

*MOV*
The format for storing and playing back audio and video files using the QuickTime media player on the Apple Macintosh, but also available for the multimedia PC. Economical in terms of storage space.

*MP4*
Abbreviation for the MPEG-4 file format. There are two basic types of MP4: MP4 AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) and MP4 AVC (Advanced Video Coding). The MP4 AAC file format is used to store audio files in a more manageable size without affecting the quality. MP4 AAC's best known use is as the default audio format of Apple's iPhone, iPod and iTunes Media Player. The MP4 AVC file format is used to store video files in a more manageable size wihout affecting the quality. It is also increasingly being used for storing video on iPods and similar portable devices.

OCR software is used conjunction with a *scanner* to convert printed text into digital format. For example, a page from a printed book can be placed on the scanner and the OCR software will be used by the scanner to detect the individual words from which it is made up and then convert them into a form that can be stored on a computer,

*Objective-C*
A programming language often used to create applications for OS X and iOS. The language is based on C and comparable to Microsoft's C Sharp, also a dialect of C.

*Open source*
The practice of allowing access to the source of product and the process through which the product has been developed. Open Source Software is the most well-known exponent of this practice.

*OS (Operating system)*

### **P**

*PDA*

*PDF (Portable Document Format)*
This is a file type created by Adobe that allows fully formatted, documents to be transmitted across the Internet and viewed on any computer that has Adobe Acrobat Reader software - a proprietary software viewing program available for free at the Adobe website: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/">http://www.adobe.com/uk/</a>. Businesses and educational institutions often use PDF-formatted files to display the original look of their brochures or for publishing a complete magazine in electronic format. Using the full Adobe Acrobat software package, it is possible to create a high-quality piece of artwork or a brochure which preserves the look of the original, complete with fonts, colours, images, and formatting. Documents in PDF format can be published on the Web without having to be converted into HTML.

*Pixel*
A contraction of picture element. What you see on a computer Display Screen1 is made up of thousands of coloured pixels or small dots, which can be set according to the user's choice to produce either low-resolution output, medium-resolution output or high-resolution output, the usual combinations of pixels across each line of the screen (horizontal pixels) and down each line of the screen (vertical pixels) being 640 x 480, 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, 1280 x 1024. Thus, the more pixels on the screen the higher the resolution (i.e. producing a finer, sharper image) and the greater the variety of colours that can be displayed.

*Platform*
Often used as an alternative term for a computer system, including both the hardware and the software. Essentially this term describes something that is used to build something else. The term *platform-independent* - used to describe software - means that the software can be run on any computer.

*Podcast*
A podcast is a broadcast digital audio recording, made available via the Web in a way that allows the recording to be downloaded for listening at the user's convenience. Cf. Vodcast, which is often used to describe a downloadable broadcast digital video recording.

*Pop-up*
A small Window that appears within a program or over the top of a Web page to deliver additional information. Pop-ups on the Web can be annoying as they are often used for unwanted advertising material.

*POD (Print-on-Demand)*
Print on demand (POD) is a digital printing technology in which a book or other publication is printed in the amount one needs it. The POD model flies in the face of traditional printing, where large quantities of books are produced in initial print runs to reduce costs prior to distribution. The sales of online books and e-books facilitate POD and eliminate the need for hard copy book displays. POD has also changed the publishing industry by reducing the need for traditional publishing houses, allowing authors to self-publish at very low costs. Print on demand is sometimes called publish on demand.

*Program*
The American spelling is standard in computer jargon, enabling a useful distinction to be made in British English between a *computer program* and a *programme* in the sense of a *programme of study*. A talk with the title "Turning programmes into programs" (or maybe it was the other way round) was presented by a British Council officer at the annual TESOL conference in the USA in 1987 - which puzzled the American audience but made sense to the British participants.

*Protocol*
In Internet terminology protocol usually refers to a set of rules that define an exact format for communication between systems. For example the HTTP protocol defines the format for communication between Web browsers and Web server.

### **Q**

*QR Code (Quick Response Code)*
A QR Code is a two-dimensional barcode that can store a variety of different types of information, e.g. text, a website URL, a telephone number, an SMS message, an email address, an email message, contact details, information about an event, a Google Maps1 location, your social media profile (Facebook, Twitter, etc), an iTunes link, a YouTube link, etc. QR Codes can be read by barcode readers and Smartphone cameras. Instead of writing down the information relating to a website URL or map location etc, you just take a photo of the QR Code.

*QuickTime*
Software by Apple used for viewing movies and listening to audio recordings

### **R**

*Reflowable*
A reflowable document is a type of electronic document that can adapt its presentation to the output device.

*Resolution*
A measure of the number of pixels or small dots displayed on a computer display screen, printer or scanner. One normally talks in terms of the quality of resolution, using the expression low-resolution, medium-resolutionand high-resolution. The resolution of a computer display screenis normally expressed as two numbers representing the horizontal and vertical resolution, i.e. dots across each line of the screen and down each line of the screen: e.g. 640 x 480, 1024 x 768, etc. The resolution of a Printer is normally referred to by the number of dots per inch (dpi)- i.e. square inch.

*RTF (Rich Text Format)*
An alternative way of storing a document created with a MS-Word-processor. RTF-formatted files can be moved relatively easily between different computer systems. RTF format is also recommended when transmitting an Attachment by Email as it is much safer than the Microsoft Word formats, which can harbour Word Macro viruses. RTF files preserve most of the formatting contained in DOC-formatted files.

### **S**

*SDK (Software Development Kit)*

*Semantic Web*
The *Semantic Web* is not a new type of Web, but rather an extension of the Web whereby data available in different locations on the Web is linked together in a way that allows the user to search the Web in a more sophisticated way, e.g. by requesting information in forms such as "Tell me where I can find information about 21st-century writers who live within 50 miles of my home town":

*Setup Program*
A program that enables the user to set up a program or suite of programs on the computer's hard disk. Also known as Install Program or Installation Program.

*sRGB color space*
sRGB is a standard RGB color space created cooperatively by HP and Microsoft in 1996 for use on monitors, printers and the Internet.


*Streaming*
Playing audio or video in real time from a website. In order to play streaming multimedia files you need a specific Plug-in program that links in with your Browser and plays the file as it is transmitted rather than downloading it to your computer first.
