#11 Glossary


###A 

#####Acronym 
An acronym is a shortened version of a phrase, often based on the first letter of each word. For example, WYSIWYG is the acronym for 'What You See Is What You Get'. Some acronyms use more than one letter from each word (or omit some words), for example EPUB is an acronym for Electronic PUBlication. 

#####Amazon 
A well-known online retailer of various goods, including print books and ebooks. Amazon also produces the Kindle e-reader devices. 

#####Anchor 
An anchor is a specific location within a HTML web page or other hypertext document that can be jumped to, for example by clicking on a hyperlink. 

#####Android 
Google's operating system for mobile phones and tablets, based on the Linux kernel and the Java programming language. Android is currently the most widely used operating system for mobile devices (including smartphones and tablets). 

#####Animated GIF 
A graphic file format consisting of two or more image frames shown as moving images in a timed sequence; most often used for endlessly looping mini-films or graphic animations that only last a few seconds. (GIF is an acroym for Graphics Interchange Format.) 

#####App store 
An online store where applications may be bought or obtained for free. Every major mobile operating system also has its own app store: App Store (Apple), Google Play, Amazon Appstore, Windows Phone Store and BlackBerry World. 

#####Application or app 
See [**Software**](#software). The word 'app' was originally a marketing term invented by Apple to win over resistance against installing third-party software on the iPhone. Nowadays, the word is most commonly used for (usually relatively small) software applications running on mobile or desktop operating systems and which are downloaded and installed from an app store. 

#####Application Programming Interface (API) 
A standardized way for software applications to communicate with each other and use each other's resources. APIs are used in software development; end users normally do not see them. 

#####ASCII 
American Standard Code for Information Interchange: the standard encoding format for plain-text files in English since 1963. ASCII is limited to 128 characters and therefore excludes diacritic (accented) characters and non-European writing systems. For written text, ASCII has therefore been superseded by Unicode (which can store characters of practically every writing system). ASCII text remains the standard format for programming and markup languages. See also [**Unicode**](#unicode). 

#####AZW 
Presumably an acronym for 'Amazon Word'. A file format used by Amazon for its Kindle range of e-reader devices and software applications. See also [**KF8**](#kf8) and [**MOBI**](#mobi). 
 
###B 

#####Bandwidth 
The physical transmission capacity of a communication channel. Often used as an expression of the maximum amount of data that can be sent via a specific network connection. The higher the bandwidth, the greater the amount of data that can be transmitted within a given time period. Bandwidth is therefore crucial for services such as video streaming (where playback would stop if the bandwidth were too low to transmit the data quickly enough). 

#####Binary 
A numeral system based on only two values, zero and one. For example, the binary representation of the number 9 is 1001. Because of the straightforward implementation of binary numbers in electronic circuits, all computing devices are ultimately based on this numeral system. 

#####Bit 
Contraction of 'binary digit'. A bit is the smallest measurement unit of computer memory or processing, or data transmission speed. The binary code '1001', for example, consists of four bits. See also [**Binary**](#binary). 

#####BitTorrent 
BitTorrent is the most popular internet technology for file sharing and downloading large amounts of data (such as movies). It works according to a principle known as 'peer-to-peer', which means that everyone who is downloading a file is simultaneously uploading it to fellow downloaders. This way, bandwidth is shared among the downloaders, and no central download server is necessary. 

#####Blog 
Short for 'web log'; usually a chronological and often personal record of thoughts, web links, events or actions, posted on the web. The difference between blogs and news/opinion websites is becoming increasingly blurry. 

#####Browser 
The software used by people for accessing and viewing websites. A web browser loads pages from servers, translates their internal HTML code into formatted text, displays graphics, plays music and video, and provides links to related pages. Web browsers are based on the file format and network standards of the World Wide Web, which are defined by the World Wide Web Consortium. In practice, however, browser manufacturers extend or deviate from those standards, which can lead to compatibility problems in web design. 

#####Browser extension 
Plug-ins (additional software modules) which extend or enhance the inner workings of a web browser, for example, by supporting the display of additional file types or media types. 

###C 

#####Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
Cascading Style Sheets are a markup language for formatting electronic text with typographical attributes (such as bold, italic, font type, font size, color, margins, etc.). CSS is most commonly used for (HTML) web pages, and by extension also for EPUB. CSS is typically stored in a separate file so that the content and the visual layout of a document remain separated from each other. Cascading Style Sheets make it easy to design a typographic template for a whole website or ebook. In order to change the typography, one only needs to edit the CSS file. Also, by using different CSS files for the same document, it also is easy to define formattings for different purposes without having to modify the document itself. 

#####Compatibility 
Pieces of hardware and/or software which work together are called compatible. Conversely, if they do not work together, they are incompatible. For example, Android and iOS are incompatible because Android apps do not work under iOS and vice versa. 

#####Compressed files 
Compression is a technique for shrinking the size of a file or a data stream. As a result it can be transmitted faster, and will take up less storage space on a device. For example, digital video is heavily compressed, otherwise it would not fit on a DVD and could not be streamed over internet connections. Another example is EPUB, which consists of a compressed collection of HTML files. Various software applications such as PKZIP, WinZip, 7zip, Stuffit, GNU gzip/tar, and many others, can compress a set of files into single-file archives, and decompress the archive back to separate files. Files with the following extensions are almost always compressed file collections: epub, tar.gz/tgz, rar and zip. 

#####Content Management System (CMS) 
Software that makes it possible to publish and manage content (text, images, etc.) on a website without having to manually create HTML files. For example, practically all blogs and all shopping websites are based on content management systems. Most content management systems use internal databases to store their information (such as blog articles or sales items). Content management systems automatically generate a web page 'on the fly' from their database contents when the page is requested by a user. See also [**Server-side scripting**](#server-side-scripting). 

###D 

#####Data 
In the context of computing, data is simply any kind of information that is stored and processed on a computing device. Generally a distinction is made between data and software: software processes data, and conversely data is processed by software (for example: a graphics software application for manipulating an image). A computer or mobile device is, in the end, simply a machine that uses software to process data. See also [**Software**](#software). 

#####Database 
An organized, structured collection of information: common examples are address books, library catalogues and retail inventories. A database consists of entries called 'records' (for example, each record could be one person's name and address), and these records are broken down into 'fields' (such as: first name, last name, street, postal code, city, etc.). This rigorous structure makes it easy to select specific subsets of information from the database based on specific search criteria (for example: select and show all people whose last name is Mulder and who live in Amsterdam). 

#####Dataset 
A dataset (or data set) is, as the word suggests, a collection of data - typically, a number of entries extracted from a database based on specific search criteria. For example: from an address database of all residents of Amsterdam, one could extract a dataset of all residents living in a particular neighborhood, and store the results in a new file. 

#####Desktop Publishing (DTP) 
The design of printed matter on a personal computer using graphical What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) software such as Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress. DTP software uses a graphical user interface to visually simulate the analog layout desks used in pre-digital times by graphic and editorial designers. 

#####Device 
In the context of mobile computing, a device is an electronic handheld gadget such as a smartphone, tablet, phablet (large-screen smartphone) or portable gaming device. 

#####Digital Rights Management (DRM) 
Technology used by publishers to restrict the usage and copying of copyright-protected digital materials (audio and video files, e-books, games, etc.). The practice of adding DRM to media is controversial, as it often obstructs paying customers from making full use of the digital goods they have purchased. For example, most files with DRM cannot be freely transferred between two devices owned by the same user. Also, it is often not possible to even access these files without an active internet connection. Finally, DRM is a major obstacle for long-term storage and accessibility of digital media. 

###E 

#####Ebook 
A digital publication which can be read on e-readers and other handheld devices, as well as desktop computers. Unlike online digital publications (such as news websites and blogs), most ebooks are meant for offline reading and individual collecting. There are various ebook formats such as EPUB and AZW, most of which are based on web design technologies such as HTML and CSS. 

#####EPUB 
Acronym for Electronic Publication. An ebook format developed by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). EPUB is an open standard and the most commonly used and supported file format for electronic books. EPUB was designed to accommodate reflowable content. See also [**Reflowable**](#reflowable). 

#####E-paper 
Electronic paper, a display technology designed to resemble printed paper rather than the LCD displays used on most other computing devices. E-paper consists of a grid of tiny electronic 'ink' particles that can be switched from black to white. Electricity is only needed for refreshing ('turning') the page; for the display itself, no electricity or battery power is needed. Since it is not backlit like an LCD, the display must be illuminated externally like conventional paper; the upside is that it can be read in broad daylight without any loss of image quality. Since the refresh rate is much slower than LCD screens, the technology does not allow for videos or animations. See also [**LCD**](#lcd). 

#####E-reader 
A device capable of displaying digital texts in various formats, notably EPUB, or in the case of Amazon's Kindle e-readers, Amazon's own proprietary formats AZW, KF8 and MOBI. Many e-readers also support PDF and other formats. 
 
###F 

#####File 
A file is an object containing data and metadata, and stored on a computer, server or mobile device. A file can contain a text, an image, a video, a software program, etc. On most computer systems, files are organized within hierarchies of folders. 

#####Filename extension 
A filename extension typically consists of three or four letters at the end of a filename, preceded by a dot (such as: .html, .mp4, .jpg/.jpeg, etc.). Filename extensions are used by many operating systems including Windows and Mac OS X to indicate the type of a file. 

#####Folder 
On most operating systems, files are grouped and hierarchically organized in folders. The term 'folder' is used synonymously with 'directory'. Folders can be hierarchically organized in a tree-like structure, so that one folder contains a number of other folders, each of which may contain yet more folders, etc. Subfolders are sometimes referred to as 'child folders' of the 'parent folder'. 

#####Formatting 
The process of applying typographic styling (bold, italic, etc.) to a text. Another unrelated meaning of the same term is: to erase and initialize a storage device (such as a hard disk or memory card). 

#####Freemium 
A revenue model in which the basic product or service (typically software, media, games or web services) is provided free of charge, but money (a premium) is charged for extra features or virtual goods. 
 
###G 

#####GitHub 
A freemium web hosting service for user-run Git repositories. Git, an Open Source software application for collaborative editing over the internet, is described in our software catalogue. 

#####Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
Software that allows human users to use a computer or other digital device in a visual-tactile way, as opposed to text-based command-line interfaces, and typically creating the 'look and feel' of a tangible physical instrument. A GUI features graphical elements such as menus, icons, pointers, check boxes, knobs, dials and sliders. By clicking and dragging these elements, the user can run and control software programs and carry out other operations such as copying information, deleting files, etc. 

###H 

#####HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
A file format and markup standard used mainly for web pages. HTML consists of ASCII files with markup tags in angular brackets, like this: `<tag>`. These tags allow the author or designer to define the structural document layout (such as the title, headlines, block quotes, lists, tables) and interaction elements (such as hyperlinks and fill-out forms). 

#####HTML5 
The most recent version of the HTML format. HTML5 adds various new features, notably support for the multimedia (audio and video) capabilities of the World Wide Web. Through the adoption of HTML5, web designers hope to render obsolete the use of browser plug-ins for interactive multimedia websites. 

#####Hybrid Publishing 
Hybrid publishing, also known as multi-channel publishing, means the publishing of a single publication in several different print and electronic media, preferably with a workflow that minimizes the effort of customizing the publication for each medium. 

#####Hyperlink 
A hyperlink (hypertext link) is a clickable cross-reference between electronic documents. By clicking a hyperlink, the user is led to another part of the document, or to a different document, web page or website. Hyperlinks are usually highlighted and/or underlined so that users can easily recognize them in the text. 

#####Hypertext 
A system for the non-linear organization of text, and arguably the fundamental underlying principle of the World Wide Web. The concept of hypertext predates the web by many years. 
 
###I 

#####iBooks 
A software application which allows users to purchase, read and manage ebooks. Developed by Apple for its iOS and Mac OS X operating systems. 

#####Icon 
A small symbol or picture used in a graphical user interface (GUI). The icons on the computer screen visually represent software programs or data files. For example, a picture of a painter's palette may be used to represent software used for drawing and editing pictures, and a picture of a book with a question mark on its cover may represent the text of a user manual or a help file. 

#####Interactivity 
In the context of computer engineering, the ways in which software accepts and responds to user input. In other words, a system is considered 'interactive' if it reacts to human input. 

#####Internet 
The internet is the global computer network connecting billions of computers all over the world (through the network protocol TCP/IP). The internet dates back to a group of interconnected computer networks in U.S. universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Contrary to popular belief, the World Wide Web (with its hypertext pages) is *not* the internet, but just one service running on top of it. (Others include e-mail, BitTorrent, and voice-over-IP services such as Skype.) 

#####iOS 
Apple's mobile operating system for the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV. 

###J 

#####JavaScript 
JavaScript is a relatively simple, special-purpose programming language for running small programs directly on web pages, within the web browser. JavaScript is very popular for common tasks such as checking whether all fields of a web form have been filled in, or for building websites that behave like software applications (such as web mail services). Despite its name, JavaScript is unrelated to the more complex programming language Java. 

#####JPEG 
Acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group, and also known as JPG. JPEG is a file format used for digital images, and particularly suitable for photographs and full-color artworks. The JPEG format has a rich color palette of millions of colors, but it also compresses data through reduction of visual details, resulting in a loss of image quality. In practice however, this loss of quality is often invisible to the human eye. 
 
###K 

#####KF8 
KF8 is the latest ebook format used by Amazon for its Kindle range of e-reader devices. Like EPUB3, it is internally based on HTML5. See also [**AZW**](#azw) and [**MOBI**](#mobi). 

#####Kindle 
Amazon's Kindle is a range of handheld e-reader devices and companion software applications for reading ebooks, particularly in Amazon's proprietary AZW, KF8 and MOBI ebook formats. 

#####Kobo 
Kobo is a company that produces a range of handheld e-reader devices and companion software. It also has its own online store where users can purchase ebooks (mainly in the EPUB format). 
 
###L 

#####LaTeX 
A document markup language in use since the 1980s, mainly for typesetting scientific documents. LaTeX is particularly useful for rendering complex mathematical formulas. 

#####Layout 
The overall visual design of a document. In the case of printed matter, layout includes elements such as page dimensions and margins, font type and size, markup formatting, the placement of various elements within the page, and various other elements such as headings and page numbers. In the case of reflowable documents such as ebooks, the layout is dynamically adapted to each screen size and screen aspect ratio. 

#####LCD 
Acronym for Liquid Crystal Display. The technology used for producing the flat-panel color display screens found on most contemporary computers, tablets and smartphones, as well as a variety of other devices. TFT (Thin Film Transistor) LCD displays are the most common type of display today, so that the term 'TFT' is often used interchangeably with 'LCD'. See also [**E-paper**](#e-paper). 

#####Linux 
A popular Open Source, Unix-compatible operating system. Linux is named after its creator Linus Torvalds, who still supervises its development by many developers worldwide. Most web servers today run Linux. Google's Android operating system is also based on Linux. (Unix, originally developed in the early 1970, is also the foundation of other operating systems such as Mac OS X and iOS.) 
 
###M 

#####Markdown 
A simple markup language for plain-text files which uses common, easily readable symbols such as #, * and _ to define document formatting. Markdown was originally developed for blogs, as a quick and easy way of writing texts that would be eventually be converted into HTML. Nowadays, Markdown can also be converted to other document formats including EPUB. See also the more powerful extension of Markdown, [**MultiMarkdown**](#multimarkdown). 

#####Markup 
Symbols/codes inserted in a text document in order to define additional attributes such as formatting instructions (bold, italics, etc.), structuring instructions (chapters, headings, references, etc.) or metadata. Based on the information contained in the markup code, software applications can render the text document for a specific output medium (such as a screen or print). 

#####Markup language 
A document format consisting of a clearly defined syntax of markup codes. Markup languages are typically created for specific purposes: For example, HTML and CSS for formatting web pages, LaTeX for scientific typesetting. 

#####Metadata 
Literally: data about data. Metadata contains general descriptions of the data contained within a particular document. For example: if a book is data, then a library index card for that book is its metadata. 

#####MOBI 
An ebook file format developed by Mobipocket, and the basis of Amazon's earliest AZW ebooks for the Kindle e-reader. See also [**AZW**](#azw) and [**KF8**](#kf8). 

#####Mobipocket 
A French company founded in 2000 that produced Mobipocket Reader, an e-reader software application that ran on some handheld computers, wireless telephones and desktop operating systems. The technology was later purchased by Amazon for its Kindle platform. 

#####Monitor 
The screen on which the output from a computer is displayed. Also referred to as display screen. 

#####Monochrome 
Monochrome images are either in one color (black and white) or shades of one color (grayscale). 

#####MP3 
Acronym for 'MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III'. A common compression format for digital audio. MP3 shrinks audio files to a fraction of their original size. The technology was developed in the 1990s and has not (yet) been superseded by newer and technically superior compression formats such as MP4 AAC. 

#####MP4 
Also known as MPEG-4. A common compression format for digital video (MP4 AVC) and audio (MP4 AAC). The MP4 AAC audio format is the default audio format for Apple's iPod, iPhone and iPad devices and iTunes store. MP4 AVC is currently the standard video compression format for BluRay, digital TV, internet video (on YouTube, Vimeo, Netflix, etc.), mobile devices and consumer video cameras. 

#####MultiMarkdown 
An extension of the markup language Markdown, with additional support for footnotes, tables, mathematical formulas, cross-references, bibliographies and definition lists. 

#####Multimedia 
The integration of two or more media (text, images, audio, video, animation, etc.) in a single document or software application. 

###O 

#####Open Source 
Open Source originally refers to software that can be freely used, copied, adapted and modified. In order to allow modification, Open Source software provides users and developers not only with the installable software, but also its human-readable 'source' code. (An analogy would be a restaurant where customers can not only order dishes, but are also given the cooking recipes for unrestricted - personal as well as commercial - reuse.) The term has also been used to describe similar practices in fields other than software development, such as design (Open Design), publishing (Open Access), engineering, and even medical research. 

#####Operating system 
The most basic piece of software running on a computer. Operating systems generally manage storage and file access as well as network connectivity, and provide a user interface including keyboard/mouse input and screen/audio output. Well-known operating systems include Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, as well as mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS. 
 
#####Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 
OCR software automatically recognizes printed text (or even handwriting) in scanned or photographed images and converts it into digital text files. 

###P 

#####PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) 
A miniature computer/handheld device with standard software applications such as an agenda, address book, notebook and web browsing. PDAs were popular from the 1990s to the mid-2000s, when they were superseded by smartphones. 

#####PDF 
Acronym for Portable Document Format. PDF was developed by Adobe Systems as a file format for ensuring that documents would retain their visual layout and typographic details, and thus be rendered identically, across all operating systems. PDF is generally a read-only format, and not a suitable format for editable documents. It originated in the field of desktop publishing and became the standard file format for master copies of print publications. Since PDF is, for the most part, a fixed-layout (as opposed to reflowable) document format, designed for print, it is less suitable than EPUB as an all-purpose electronic publishing format. Since 2008, PDF has been an open standard. 

#####Pixel 
All text and images on a display screen are made up of a grid of thousands (or even millions) of small colored dots known as pixels. The term 'pixel' is derived from 'picture element'. See also [**Resolution**](#resolution). 

#####Plain text 
Text without any visual formatting (such as bold, italic, font types and sizes, clickable hyperlinks, etc.). ASCII is the oldest and still most common plain-text format. 

#####Platform 
A generic term to describe technology that serves as a foundation for other technology. For example, the internet is a platform for other network services, and operating systems are platforms for other software applications. (Platform-independent software can, theoretically, run on any computer.) 

#####Print On Demand (POD) 
Print on demand (POD) is a digital printing technology in which a book or other publication is not printed in an edition of several hundred or thousand copies, but in individual copies 'on demand' based on a single customer's order. The emergence of POD has had a significant impact on the publishing industry, as it allowed authors for the first time to self-publish at a very low cost. Print on demand is sometimes also called publishing on demand. 

#####Program 
The terms program, software, application and app are often used more or less interchangeably. A program tells a computer or mobile device what to do. Programs are usually written in 'high-level' programming languages (such as C, C++, Java, Python) which are a mixture of English-language commands and mathematical-logical expressions. See also [**Software**](#software). 

#####Protocol 
In computing and networking, a protocol is a technical standard according to which two systems communicate with each other. For example, the HTTP protocol defines the format for communication between web browsers and web servers. (Or, to use an 'old media' example: frequency modulation (FM) is the technical protocol for most radio transmissions.) 
 
###R 

#####Reflowable 
A reflowable document is a document without a predefined page layout, in which the page dimensions are dynamically and automatically adapted (including page breaks) to each screen size and screen aspect ratio. This means, for example, that an ebook may appear as 50 A5-size pages on a tablet, but as 100 A6-size pages on an e-reader. This also means that the designer no longer has control of the final page layout. The concept is also known as 'responsive design'. 

#####Resolution 
The smaller a pixel, the higher the visual resolution of any display. Resolution is commonly expressed as the number of dots per square inch (dpi) of a printed output or display. For digital print the industry standard is 300-600 dpi, for offset print 600-1200 dpi. Electronic screens traditionally had resolutions of 72-100 dpi, but the most recent generations of tablets and smartphones feature screen resolutions of 300-600 dpi. See also [**Pixel**](#pixel). 

#####RTF 
Acronym for Rich Text Format. A document format established in 1987 as an alternative format for Microsoft Word documents. Contrary to common belief, RTF is not an open standard and does not solve compatibility problems between word processing formats. 
 
###S 

#####Server-side scripting 
Server-side scripting means that, rather than transferring a previously defined web page from a web server to a web browser, the page (or part of the page) is instead dynamically generated by software running on the server. All content management systems are based on server-side scripting. A related concept is client-side scripting, where the software (for example JavaScript) is not run on the web server, but inside the user's web browser. 

#####Software 
Structured sets of instructions to be performed by a computer or handheld device. Software can be contrasted with hardware (the actual physical device), and also with data (the information processed by the software). The terms software, computer program, application and app are often used more or less interchangeably. 

#####Software Development Kit (SDK) 
A collection of tools and services for software developers who wish to program applications for one particular operating system or platform. SDKs are usually created by the vendors of those systems: for example, both iOS and Android have their own specific SDKs. 

#####Streaming 
Direct audio or video playback from a website, without having to download the whole file first. Today, the most common streaming formats are MP3 and MPEG-4. Streaming requires a broadband connection to the internet, with good bandwidth. See also [**bandwidth**](#bandwidth).

#####Style sheet 
In book and journal publishing, a style sheet is an instruction document for authors that tells them which editorial conventions they need to follow while preparing their manuscript for publication. In graphic design, style sheets also refer to design templates. See [**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**](#cascading-style-sheets-css). 

#####Syntax 
In computing, syntax means the correct notation of a markup, command-line or programming language. Since computers cannot interpret ambiguity, 'syntax errors' easily occur in these languages; one small typo in a complex computer program will often stop the program from working altogether. 
 
###T 

#####Tablet 
A tablet is a compact portable computer that is operated via a touchscreen and has a larger screen than a smartphone. Apple's iPad is a typical example of a tablet computer. 

#####Tagging 
Tags are (typically) short strings of text that contain metadata. In electronic publishing, there are two widespread forms of tags: markup tags for the (visual-typographic and logical) formatting of a document, and general metadata tags which describe and categorize the document as a whole (such as: information on the author and publisher of an ebook). 

#####Text editor 
Software for writing and editing plain text. Unlike word processors such as Microsoft Word, text editors do not combine text writing and text formatting within one software application. Many text editors provide more powerful text processing functions than word processors, as well as specific assistance for writing in markup and programming languages. 

###U 

#####Unicode 
Unicode is today's standard format for encoding plain text. Unlike its predecessor ASCII which is limited to the English alphabet, Unicode supports almost all writing systems. For example, classical texts of many historical written languages (such as Sanskrit) can be written in Unicode. 
 
###W 

#####Word processor 
Since the invention of personal computers, word processors have been among the most widely used computer software. Today's word processors like Microsoft Word and OpenOffice/LibreOffice have in fact become hybrids between text editors and desktop publishing software. However, since they work according to the WYSIWYG paradigm, the use of word processor documents in markup-oriented hybrid publishing workflows is problematic. 
 
#####WWW (World Wide Web) 
Often referred to simply as the web, the WWW has become so popular that most people no longer distinguish it from the internet as a whole. The World Wide Web was created in the early 1990s as a hypertext electronic publishing system for the internet. (Before the World Wide Web, the standard internet services were e-mail, discussion groups [Usenet], chat [IRC] and file downloads [FTP].) The WWW makes use of the HTML and CSS file formats as well as the HTTP network protocol, and is accessed via web browsers. 

#####WYSIWYG 
Acronym for What You See Is What You Get. A concept introduced with graphical user interfaces and desktop publishing in the 1980s. It means that while designing a document on a computer, it will look on the screen exactly as it will later look in print. 

###X 

#####XHTML 
Acronym for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. A version of HTML based on XML. It generally has the same markup as HTML, but a stricter syntax that conforms to XML rules. XHTML was supposed to supersede standard HTML for the web, but has not been widely adopted. Instead, the competing format HTML5 has become the new standard. 

#####XML 
Acronym for Extensible Markup Language. XML is a markup language for constructing markup languages. In other words, it provides a syntax according to which specific markup languages can be built. (Based on XML, one could for example define a specific markup language for restaurant menus, for work schedules, or for poetry books, each of them containing self-defined customized tags.) An example of a markup language constructed with XML is XHTML. EPUB internally uses the XML-compliant 'Open Packaging Format' for cataloguing the different source files (text chapters, images etc.) used in an ebook.
