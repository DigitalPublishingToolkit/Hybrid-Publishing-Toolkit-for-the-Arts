#10 Glossary of technical terms 


###A 

#####Acronym 
An acronym is a shortened version of a phrase, often based on the first letter of each word. For example, WYSIWYG is the acronym for 'What You See Is What You Get'. 

#####Amazon 
A well-known online retailer of various goods, including print books and ebooks. Amazon also produces the Kindle and Kindle Fire e-reader devices. 

#####Anchor 
An anchor is a specific location within a HTML web page that can be jumped to after having clicked a hyperlink. 

#####Android 
Google's operating system for mobile phones and tablets, based on the Linux kernel and the Java programming language. Android is currently the most widely used operating system for mobile devices (including smartphones and tablets). 

#####Animated GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) 
A graphic file that consists of two or more image frames shown as moving images in a timed sequences; most often used for endlessly looping mini films or graphic animations that only last a few seconds.

#####API (Application Programming Interface) 
A standardized way for two software **applications** to talk to each other and use each other's functions. APIs are used in software development; users normally do not see them.

#####Application or app 
A computer program. The word "app" was originally a marketing term invented by Apple to take the fear out of the installation of third-party software on the iPhone. Nowadays, the word is most commonly used for software programs running on mobile or desktop operating systems that downloaded and installed from an app store (such as Google Play store and Apple App Store). 

#####App store 
<<<<<<< HEAD
An online store where applications may be bought or obtained for free. Every major mobile operating system also has its own app store: App Store (Apple), Google Play, **Amazon** Appstore, Windows Phone Store and BlackBerry App World. 

#####ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) 
The standard encoding of English plain text files since 1963. ASCII is limited to 128 characters and therefore excludes accented and non-European characters. For written text, it has therefore been superseded by Unicode (which can store characters of practically every alphabet in the world). ASCII text remains the standard format for programming and *markup* languages.

#####AZW (Amazon Word) 
A file format used by **Amazon** for its Kindle range of e-reader devices and software applications. See also **KF8** and **MOBI**.

#####ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) 
A standard way of encoding uppercase and lowercase letters in the English alphabet, as well as numbers and some special characters. ASCII uses only seven bits and is therefore limited to 128 characters. 

#####AZW (Amazon Word) 
A file format used by Amazon for its Kindle range of e-reader devices and software applications. See also **KF8** and **MOBI**.

###B 

#####Bandwidth 
<<<<<<< HEAD
The physical transmission capacity of a communication channel. Often used as an expression of the maximum amount of **data** that can be sent via a certain network connection. The higher the bandwidth, the greater the amount of data that can be transmitted within a given time period. Bandwidth is therefore crucial, among others, for video streaming (where playback would stop if the bandwidth is too low to transmit data fast enough).
=======
Literally, the frequency width of a transmission channel, expressed in hertz, kilohertz, megahertz, etc. Often used to express the amount of data that can be sent through a circuit. The higher the bandwidth, the greater the amount of data that can travel within a given time period. 
>>>>>>> 465f9081dd855ebeba4eab618367725598cb337c

#####Binary 
A numeral system based on only two values - in computing, zero and one. (For example, the binary representation of the number 9 is 1001.)

#####Bit 
<<<<<<< HEAD
Contraction of *binary digit*. A bit is the smallest measurement unit of computer memory or data transmission speed - e.g., either a zero or a one. The binary code "1001"  therefore consists of four bits.
=======
Contraction of 'binary digit'. A bit is the smallest measurement unit of computer memory or data transmission speed. 
>>>>>>> 465f9081dd855ebeba4eab618367725598cb337c

#####BitTorrent 
BitTorrent is the most popular Internet technology for file sharing and downloading large amounts of data (such as movies). It works on a so-called peer-to-peer principle, which means that everyone who downloads a file simultaneously uploads it to fellow downloaders. This way, **bandwidth** is shared among the downloaders, and no central download server is necessary. 

#####Blog 
Short for web log; usually a chronological and often personal record of thoughts, web links, events, or actions posted on the Web. Lately, the difference between blogs and news and opinion web sites has become blurry. 

#####Browser 
The software with which people access and read web sites. A web browser loads pages from servers, translates their internal **HTML** code into a formatted text, displays graphics, plays music and video, and provides links to related pages. Web browsers work on the basis of the file format and network standards of the World Wide Web that are defined by the World Wide Web Consortium. In practice, however, browser manufacturers extend or deviate from those standards, which can lead to **compatibility** problems of a web design.

#####Browser extension 
Plugins (additional software modules) to extend or enhance the inner workings of a web browser, for example, by supporting the display additional file or media types.

#####Byte 
<<<<<<< HEAD
A measurement of computer memory or storage capacity. A byte is simply 8 *bits*. There is no scientific reason why eight bits should be called a "byte" - it's simply an engineering convention.
=======
A measurement of computer memory or storage capacity. A byte comprises 8 bits.

###C 

#####Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
Cascading Style Sheets are a **markup** language for formatting electronic text with typographical attributes (such as bold, italic, typeface, point size, color, margin etc.). CSS is most commonly used for (HTML) web pages and by extension also for EPUB; it is typically stored in a separate file so that content and visual layout of a document remain separated from each other. Cascading Style Sheets make it easy to design a typographic template for a whole website or ebook. To change the typography, one only needs to edit the CSS file. By using different alternative CSS files for the same document, it also is easy to create different typographies for different purposes without having to re-author the document itself.

#####Compatibility 
Pieces of hardware and/or software which work together are called compatible. (Conversely, if they do not work together, they are incompatible. For example, **Android** and **iOS** are incompatible because Android *apps* do not work under **iOS** and vice versa.)

#####Compressed files 
<<<<<<< HEAD
Compression is a technique for shrinking the size of a file or a data stream. As a result, its transmission can be faster, and it will take up less storage space on a **device**. For example, digital video is heavily compressed, otherwise it would not fit on a DVD and could not be streamed over Internet connections. Another example is **EPUB**, which consists a compressed sets of HTML files. Various software programs will compress and decompress a set files into single-file archives, such as PKZIP, WinZip, 7zip, Stuffit, GNU gzip/tar, and many more. Files with the following extensions are almost always compressed file collections: epub, gz, rar and zip. 

#####Computer program 
The terms computer program, computer software and application/app are interchangeable. Programs tell a computer what to do. They are written in programming languages (such as C, C++, Java, Python) whose notation is a mixture of English-language commands and mathematical-logical expressions. 
=======
Compression is a technique for making a file or a data stream smaller for faster transmission, or to take up less storage space. An example is EPUB, which is a compressed collection of HTML files. There are various software programs for compressing and decompressing files, such as PKZIP, WinZip, Stuffit, GNU gzip, and many more. Files with the following extensions are almost always compressed files: arc, arj, epub, gz, lha, lhz, taz, tgz, Z, zip, and zoo. 

#####Computer program 
A set of instructions carried out in sequence by the computer to perform a given task. Programs are usually written in English-like programming languages (e.g. C, Pascal, Java, C++), and are then converted into binary machine instructions by special software known as a compiler or an interpreter. Almost all modern software applications consist of collections of programs working together to perform various tasks. 
>>>>>>> 465f9081dd855ebeba4eab618367725598cb337c

#####Content Management System (CMS) 
A computer program that makes it easy to publish and manage content (text, images, etc.) on a website without having to write **HTML** files by hand. Practically all blogs and all shopping web sites, for example, are based on content management systems. Most content management systems internally use a **databases** to store their information (such as: blog articles, sales items). Content management systems automatically generate all pages of a web site "on the fly", whenever readers access them, from their database contents.

###D 

#####Data 
<<<<<<< HEAD
In computing, data simply is any kind of information that is stored and processed on a computer. One generally separates data from *computer programs*: programs process data (for example: a graphics program that manipulates an image), and data conversely is processed by programs. A computer, in the end, is nothing more than a machine that processes data through computer programs.

#####Database 
An organized, structured collection of information: common examples are address books, library catalogs and shop inventories. A database consists of entries (such as: addresses), and these entries are broken down into fields (such as: first name, last name, street, zip code, city). Thanks to this rigorous structure, it is easy to select specific pieces of information from the database based on specific search criteria (for example: select and show all people whose last name is "Mulder" and who live in Amsterdam).

#####Dataset
A dataset (or data set) is just what the word says: a collection of data - typically, a number of entries extracted from a database based on a specific search criterium. (For example: From an address database of all residents of Amsterdam, one could extract a dataset of all residents living in a particular neighborhood, and store it in a new file.)
=======
In the context of computing, data is information stored in a form that can be processed by computer software. 

#####Database 
A structured collection of data, often in a format that can be processed by a computer. 

#####Dataset
A collection of data, often as part of a database.

#####Decompress 
See **Compressed files**. 

#####Desktop Publishing (DTP) 
<<<<<<< HEAD
The design of printed matter on a personal computer using graphical What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) software like Adobe InDesign or Quark XPress. The **graphical user interface** DTP software visually imitates the analog layout desks that graphic and editorial designers used in pre-digital times.
=======
The practice of designing printed matter on a personal computer, often using software such as Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress. 
>>>>>>> 465f9081dd855ebeba4eab618367725598cb337c

#####Device 
In the context of mobile computing, an electronic handheld gadget such as a smartphone, tablet, phablet (large screen smartphone) or portable gaming device. 

#####Digital Rights Management (DRM) 
Technology used by publishers to restrict the usage and copying of copyright-protected digital materials (audio and video files, e-books, games, etc.). The practice of adding DRM to media is controversial, as it often obstructs paying customers to fully use the digital goods they have purchased. For example, most files with DRM cannot be freely transferred between different electronic devices one owns and uses. Also, accessing these files without an active Internet connection is often impossible. Finally, DRM is a major obstacle for long-term storage and accessibility of digital media. 

#####Directory 
See **Folder**. 

#####Dots Per Inch (DPI) 
A measure of visual resolution in the number of dots per square inch on a display. For digital print 300-600 dpi are the standard, for offset print 600-1200 dpi. Electronic screens used to have resolutions of 72-100 dpi, but for the most recent generations of tablets and smartphone, screen resolution has increased to 300-600 dpi. See also **Resolution**. 


###E 

#####Ebook 
<<<<<<< HEAD
A digital publication which can be read on e-readers and other handheld devices as well as desktop computers. As opposed to digital online publications (such as news web sites and blogs), most ebooks are meant for offline reading and individual collecting. There are various ebook formats such as EPUB and AZW, but most of them are based on web design technologies (such as HTML and CSS). 
=======
A digital publication that can be displayed by e-readers and other handheld devices as well as desktop computers. There are various ebook formats such as EPUB and AZW. 
>>>>>>> 465f9081dd855ebeba4eab618367725598cb337c

#####EPUB (Electronic Publication) 
An ebook format developed by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). EPUB has been designed to accommodate reflowable content, e.g. to have layouts without predefined page dimensions that can dynamically adapt to any screen format. EPUB is an open standard and the most commonly used and supported file format for electronic books.

#####E-paper 
Or electronic paper: a display technology that resembles printed paper more than computer screens. E-Paper consists of electronic ink particles that can turn either black or white. Electricity is only need for refreshing ('turning') the page; for the display itself, no electricity or battery power is needed. Since it is not backlit like an LCD, it must be illuminated externally like conventional paper. Since the refresh rate is much slower than LCD screens, the technology does not allow for videos or animations. 

#####E-reader 
A device capable of displaying digital texts in various formats, notably EPUB. Many e-readers also support the PDF format.

###F 

#####File 
A file is a piece of **data** stored on a computer, and having its own **metadata** (such as a file name). A file can contain a text, an image, a video, a computer program, etc. On most computer systems, files are organized within hierarchies of **folders**. 

#####File name extension 
A file name extension typically consists of three or four letters at the end of a file name, preceded by a dot (such as: ".html", ".mp4", ".jpg" etc.). It is used by many operating systems including Windows and Mac OS X to indicate the type of a file. 

#####File permissions 
On computer operating systems that allow different user logins (such as Linux, Mac OS X, Windows), every file has defined access permissions. These are **metadata** that define which users are allowed to read, edit or (in the case of a program file) execute a particular file. This is especially important on servers: For a web site, permissions make sure that the computer user can edit files but that the rest of the world can only read them.  

#####Folder 
On most operating systems, the principle of grouping and hierarchically organizing *files*. The term 'folder' is used synonymously with 'directory'. Folder can be stacked in a tree structure so that one folder contains a number of other folders each of which contains yet another number of folders, etc. Subfolders are sometimes referred to as 'child folders' of the 'parent folder'. 

#####Formatting 
The process of applying typographic styling (bold, italic, etc.) to text. Another, unrelated meaning of the same word is to erase and initialize a storage device (such as a hard disk or memory card).

#####Freemium 
A revenue model in which the basic product or service (typically software, media, games or web services) is provided free of charge, but money (a premium) is charged for extra features or virtual goods. 


###G 

#####GitHub 
A **freemium** web hosting service for user-run git repositories. **Git**, an Open Source software program for collaborative editing over the Internet, is described in our software catalogue. 

#####Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
Software that allows human users to use a computer or other digital device in a visual-tactile way, as opposed to text-based command-line interfaces, and typically by creating the "look and feel" of a tangible instrument. A GUI features graphical elements such as knobs, dials, sliders, menus, icons and pointers. By clicking and dragging these elements, the user can run programs and carry out other operations such as copying information, deleting files, etc. 

#####Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) 
A file format invented in the 1980s and used for simple graphics. GIF files use a limited palette of up to 256 colors which makes the format unsuitable for photographs and full-color artworks. Despite its age and limitations, the GIF format has survived because of its suitability for animated (moving) images, see **Animated GIF**. See also **JPEG**.


###H 

#####HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
A file format and **markup** standard mainly used for web pages. HTML consists of **ASCII** files with **markup** tags in angular brackets. These tags allows the author or designer to define structural document layout (such as: title, headlines, blockquotes, lists, tables) and interaction elements (such as: **hyperlinks** and fill-out forms).

#####HTML5
The most recent version of the **HTML** file format that, among others, greatly extends the multimedia (audio and video) capabilities of the **World Wide Web**. Through the adoption of HTML5, web designer hope to obsolete the use of **browser** plug-ins for **interactive** **multimedia** web sites.

#####HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) 
The network protocol (e.g. transport code) used on the World Wide Web for transmitting and receiving web pages. When some  uses the web, he or she requests **HTML** pages; the web **browser** software sends this request via http to the web server hosting the page, then the web server sends back the page via HTTP to the browser.

#####Hybrid Publishing 
Hybrid publishing, also known as multichannel publishing, means the publishing of a single publication in several different print and electronic media, preferably with a workflow that minimizes the effort of customizing the publication for each medium. 

#####Hyperlink 
A hyperlink (hypertext link) is a clickable cross-reference between electronic documents. By clicking a hyperlink, the user is led to another part of the document, or to a different document, web page or website. Hyperlinks are usually highlighted and/or underlined so that users can easily recognize them in the text. See also **Hypertext**. 

#####Hypertext 
A system for the non-linear organisation of text and arguably the fundamental underlying principle of the World Wide Web. The concept of hypertext predates the Web by many years. See also **Hyperlink**. 


###I 

#####iBooks 
A software application which allows users to purchase, read and manage ebooks. Developed by Apple for its **iOS** and Mac OS X operating systems. 

#####Icon 
A small symbol or picture used in a **graphical user interface** (GUI). The icons on the computer screen visually represent programs or files. For example, a picture of a painter's palette may be used to represent software used for drawing and editing pictures, and a picture of a book with a question mark on its cover may represent the text of a user manual or a help file. 

#####Incompatibility 
See **Compatibility**. 

#####Interactivity 
In the context of computer engineering, the ways in which software accepts and responds to user input. In other words, a system is "interactive" if it reacts to human input. 

#####Interface 
An interface is a hardware or software connection between two systems, or between a system and a human user. For example, the USB interface between a computer and a printer, or the software interface for exchanging data between two software applications. The software and hardware interface that allows a human user to communicate with a computer is also known as a user interface. See also **Graphical user interface**. 

#####Internet 
The Internet is the global computer network connecting billions of computers all over the world (through the network protocol TCP/IP). The Internet dates to American university computer networks of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Contrary to popular belief, the World Wide Web (with its **hypertext** pages) is *not* the Internet, but just one service running on top of it. (Others are, for example, E-Mail, *Bittorrent* and Voice-over-IP services like Skype.)

#####iOS 
Apple's mobile operating system for the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV. 


###J 

#####JavaScript 
JavaScript is a small, special-purpose programming language for running small programs directly on web pages, within the web **browser**. JavaScript is very popular for common tasks such as checking whether all fields of a web form have been filled in, or for building websites that behave like software **applications** (like, for example, web mail services). Despite its name, JavaScript is unrelated to the more complex programming language Java.

#####JPEG or JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) 
A file format used for digital images. The JPEG format is primarily intended for photographs and full-color artworks. Unlike the **GIF** format, the JPEG format has a rich color palette of millions of colors. But it also compresses data through reduction of visual details, resulting in a loss of image quality. For full-color images, the JPEG format nevertheless yields better results, with smaller file sizes, than the GIF format. 


###K 

#####KF8 
KF8 is the latest ebook format used by **Amazon** for its Kindle hardware. Like EPUB, it is internally based on **HTML5**. See also **AZW** and **MOBI**. 

#####Kindle 
**Amazon**'s Kindle is a range of handheld e-reader devices and companion software applications for reading ebooks, particularly in Amazon's proprietary **AZW**, **KF8** and MOBI ebook formats. 

#####Kobo 
Kobo is a company that produces a range of handheld e-reader devices and software. It also has its own online store where users can purchase ebooks (mainly in the EPUB format). 


###L 

#####LaTeX 
A document **markup** language in use since the 1980s, mainly for typesetting scientific documents. LaTeX is particularly useful for rendering complex mathematical formulas. 

#####Layout
The overall visual design of a document. In the case of printed matter, layout includes elements such as page dimensions and margins, font type and size, markup formatting, the placement of various elements within the page, and various other elements such as headings and page numbers. In the case of reflowable documents such as ebooks, the layout must dynamically adapt to any screen size and screen aspect ratio.  

#####LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) 
The technology used for producing the flat-panel color display screens found on most contemporary computers, tablets and smartphones as well as other devices. TFT (Thin Film Transistor) LC displays are most common today so that the name "TFT" is often used interchangeably with "LCD". See also **E-paper**.

#####Linux 
A popular Open Source, Unix-compatible operating system. Linux is named after its creator Linus Torvalds who still supervises its development through many developers worldwide. Most web servers today run Linux. Google's **Android** operating system is also based on Linux.


###M 

#####Markdown 
A simple **markup** language for plain text files which uses common, easily readable symbols such as #, * and _ to define document formatting. Markdown was originally developed for blogs as a quick and easy  way of writing texts that would be eventually be converted into **HTML**. Nowadays, Markdown can also translated into other document formats including **EPUB**. See also the more powerful extension of Markdown, **MultiMarkdown**. 

#####Markup
Symbols/codes inserted in a text document to define additional attributes. These attributes can be, for example, formatting instructions (such as bold, italics, etc.), structuring instructions (such as chapters, headings, references, etc.) or **metadata**. On the basis of the information contained in the markup code, software programs can format the text document for a specific output medium (such as a screen or print).

#####Markup language 
<<<<<<< HEAD
A defined set or system of markup codes that amounts to a document format. Markup languages are typically created for specific purposes: **HTML** for formatting web pages, **LaTeX** for scientific typesetting, for example.
=======
A clearly defined system of markup elements. As with human languages, each markup language has its own rules of vocabulary and syntax. 
>>>>>>> 465f9081dd855ebeba4eab618367725598cb337c

#####Metadata 
Literally: data about data. Metadata contains more general descriptions of the data contained in a particular document.  For example: if a book is data, then a library index card for that book is its metadata.

#####MOBI 
An ebook file format developed by Mobipocket, and the basis of **Amazon**'s first AZW ebooks for the Kindle e-reader. See also **AZW** and **KF8**. 

#####Mobipocket 
A French company founded in 2000 that produced Mobipocket Reader, an e-reader software application that ran on some handheld computers, wireless telephones and desktop operating systems. The technology was later purchased by **Amazon** for its Kindle platform. 

#####Monitor 
The screen on which the output from a computer is displayed. Also referred to as display screen. 

#####Monochrome 
Monochrome images are either in one color (black and white) or shades of one color (grayscale).  

#####MP3 (MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III)
A common compression format for digital audio. MP3 shrinks audio files to a fraction of their original size. The technology was developed in the 1990s and has not (yet) been superseded by newer and technically superior compression formats such as MP4 AAC. 

#####MP4 / MPEG-4 
A common compression format for digital video (MP4 AVC) and audio (MP4 AAC). The MP4 AAC audio format is the default audio format for Apple's iPod, iPhone and iPad devices and iTunes music shop. MP4 AVC currently is the standard video compression format for BluRay, digital TV, Internet video (on YouTube, Vimeo, Netflix), mobile devices and consumer video cameras. 

#####MultiMarkdown 
An extension of the markup language Markdown, with additional support for footnotes, tables, mathematical formulas, cross-references, bibliographies and definition lists. 
 
#####Multimedia 
The integration of two or more media (text, images, audio, video, animation, etc.) in a single work. 


###O 

#####OCR (Optical Character Recognition) 
OCR software automatically recognizes writing on scanned or photographed images and turns it into digital text files. 

#####Open Source 
Open Source originally refers to software that can be freely used, copied, adapted and modified. To allow modification, Open Source software gives people not only the installable computer program, but also its program code. (Analogous to a restaurant where customers get not only served the dishes, but are also given the cooking recipes for unrestricted - personal and commercial - reuse.) The term has also been used to describe similar practices in fields other than software development, such as design (Open Design), publishing (Open Access), engineering and even medical research. 

#####Operating system (OS) 
The most basic piece of software running on a computer. Most operating systems manage disk and file access, keyboard and mouse input, screen and audio output, network connectivity, and provide a user interface. Well-known operating systems include Windows, **Linux**, Mac OS X as well as mobile operating systems such as **Android** and **iOS.** 


###P 

#####PDA (Personal Digital Assistant)
A mini computer/handheld device with standard software applications such as an agenda, address book, notes and web browsing. PDAs were popular in the 1990s to mid-2000s but were superseded by smartphones. 

#####PDF (Portable Document Format) 
PDF was developed by Adobe Systems as a file format to ensure that a document would retain its visual layout and all its typographic details so that it would look the same across all **operating systems**. PDF is, for the most part, a read-only format, not a format for editable documents. It derived from **Desktop Publishing** and is the standard file format for master copies of print publications. Since PDF is, for the most part, a fixed-layout (as opposed to reflowable) document format designed for print, it is less suitable as an all-purpose electronic publishing format than **EPUB**. Since 2008, PDF has been an open standard. 

#####Pixel 
All text and images on a display screen are made up of a grid of thousands (or even millions) of small colored dots known as pixels. The term 'pixel' is derived from 'picture element'. See also **Resolution**. 

#####Plain text 
Text without any visual formatting such as bold, italic, font types and sizes, clickable hyperlinks, etc. **ASCII** is the oldest and still most common plain text format.

#####Platform 
A generic term to describe technology that serves as a foundation for other technology. For example, the Internet is a platform for other network services, and **operating systems** are platform for other software applications. (Platform-independent software can, theoretically, run on any computer.) 

#####Print On Demand (POD) 
Print on demand (POD) is a digital printing technology in which a book or other publication is not printed in an edition of a couple of hundred or thousands copies, but 'on demand' as an individually printed copy upon a customer's order. The emergence of POD has had great impact on the publishing industry because for the first time, it enabled authors to self-publish at very low costs. Print on demand is sometimes also called publishing on demand. 

#####Program 
See **Computer program**.

#####Protocol 
In computing, a protocol is the technical standard according to which two systems communicate with each other. For example, the **HTTP** protocol defines the format for communication between web browsers and web servers. (Or to use an old media example: frequency modulation (FM) is the technical protocol for most radio transmissions.)

###R 

#####Reflowable 
<<<<<<< HEAD
A reflowable document is a document without a predefined page layout that can dynamically adapt its page dimensions - and dynamically re-breaks pages - to any display dimensions. This concept is also known as "responsive design". It means, for example, that an ebook appears as 50 A5-size pages on a tablet, but as 100 A6-size pages on an e-reader. This also means that the designer has no more control over the final page layout.

#####Resolution 
The smaller a **pixel**, the higher the visual resolution of any display. See **DPI**.

#####Rich Text Format (RTF) 
A document format established for Microsoft Word in 1987. Contrary to common assumptions, RTF is not an open standard and does not solve compatibility problems between word processing formats.
=======
A reflowable document is a type of electronic document in which the layout and presentation can be automatically adapted for each particular output device, as well as the individual user's preferences. For example, an EPUB is a reflowable document. 

#####Resolution 
A measure of the number of pixels or small dots that can be displayed by a computer display screen, printer or scanner. The resolution of a computer display screen is often expressed as two numbers, one for the horizontal and the other for the vertical resolution: 640x480, 1024x768, 1920x1080, etc. The resolution of a printer is normally expressed as the number of dots per inch (dpi). See also **DPI**. See also **Pixel**. 

#####Rich Text Format (RTF) 
An alternative way of storing a document created with Microsoft Word. RTF files can be transferred relatively easily across different computer platforms, while preserving most of the formatting of Microsoft Word .doc and .docx files.

#####Server-side scripting 
<<<<<<< HEAD
Server-side scripting means that a web page is not simply a conventional file that gets transferred from a web server to a web *browser* - but that a computer programs runs on the which dynamically generates the page, for example from a **database**. Server-side scripting is the basis of all **content management systems**. The corresponding  to server-side scripting is **Javascript** where a computer program is not run on the web server, but in the web browser.

#####Software Development Kit (SDK) 
A collection of computer for software developers who want to program **applications** for one particular **operating system** or **platforms**. SDKs are usually created by the vendors of those systems: For example, both **iOS** and **Android** have their own specific SDKs. 

#####Streaming 
Direct audio or video playback from a website, without having to download a file first. Today, the most common streaming formats are **mp3** and **MPEG-4**. Streaming requires a broadband connection to the Internet, with good **bandwidth**. 

#####Style sheet
In book and journal publishing, a style sheet is an instruction document for authors that tells them which editorial conventions they need to followed in preparing their manuscript for publication. In graphic design, style sheets also refer to design templates, see **Cascading Style Sheets**.
=======
Server-side scripting is a web server technique in which web pages are generated dynamically on web server in response to an individual user's request or behavior. 

#####Software Development Kit (SDK) 
A collection of tools and services made available to developers in order to create applications for a specific operating system or web platform. 

#####Streaming 
Playing audio or video in real time from a website, in a continuous stream while it is being transmitted, rather than downloading and storing it on the user's computer. In order to stream multimedia files the user usually needs to install specific plug-in software which is integrated with the web browser. High-resolution streaming requires a broadband connection. 

#####Style sheet
A list of definitions linking formatting concepts such as 'bold', 'heading', or 'paragraph' to specific display representations. The use of style sheets makes it possible to easily change the presentation for different output formats. See also **Cascading Style Sheets**.

#####Syntax 
In computing, syntax means the correct notation of a markup or programming language. It is easy to produce "syntax errors" in these languages because computers do not understand ambiguity; one accidental typo in a complex computer program source will therefore stop the program from working altogether.

###T 

#####Tablet 
A tablet is compact portable **device** that is operated via a touchscreen and has a larger screen than a smartphone. Apple's iPad is a typical example of a tablet computer. 

#####Tagging 
Tags are labels - e.g. short pieces of (typically) text that contain **metadata**. In electronic publishing, there are two widespread forms of tags: **markup** tags for the (visual-typographic and logical) formatting of a document, and general metadata tags with which a whole document is described and classified (such as: the author and publisher information for an ebook).

#####Text editor 
A computer program for writing and editing **plain text**. Unlike word processors like Microsoft Word, text editors do not combine text writing and text formatting in one software application. They often offer more powerful text processing functions than word processors and specific assistance for writing in **markup** and programming languages.

#####TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) 
A file format for storing high quality **pixel** graphics. Since TIFF images can store a deeper color palette than **JPEG** and **GIF**, they are commonly used for high-resolution print design. TIFF is not a common file format for electronic publishing where higher **compression** and smaller file sizes (to save **bandwidth**) are higher priorities.
 
#####Tumblr 
Tumblr is a blogging service (with its own **content management system**) owned by Yahoo Inc.

###U 

#####Unicode 
Unicode is today's standard format for encoding **plain text**. Unlike its predecessor **ASCII** that is limited to the Roman/English alphabet, it supports nearly all alphabets  of the world. In addition, classical texts of many historical written languages (such as Sanskrit) can be written in Unicode.

#####Unix 
Unix is a computer **operating system** originally developed by the telephone company AT&T in the early 1970s. It was the first widely used operating system that allowed multiple users to simultaneously login and work on the same computer. Many core technologies of the **Internet** derived from Unix development, and most Internet servers today run modern versions of Unix (mostly **Linux**). Next to Linux,
Mac OS X is fully Unix-compatible, **iOS** and **Android** are based on Unix technology.
 

###W 

#####Word processor 
Ever since the invention of personal computers, word processors belong to the most widely used computer programs.  Technically, today's word processors like Microsoft Word and OpenOffice/LibreOffice have become hybrids of **text editors** and **desktop publishing** programs. Since the follow the **WYSIWYG** paradigm, it has become difficult to use word processor documents in **markup**-oriented **hybrid publishing workflows**.


#####WWW (World Wide Web) 
Often referred to simply as the Web, the WWW has become so popular that most people no longer differentiate from the **Internet** as a whole. The World Wide Web was created in the early 1990s as a **hypertext** electronic publishing system for the Internet. (Before the World Wide Web, the standard Internet services were only E-Mail, discussion groups [Usenet], chats [IRC] and file downloads [FTP].) It technically consists on the **HTML** and **Cascading Style Sheets** file formats and the **HTTP** network protocol, and is accessed via web **browsers**. 

#####WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) 
A concept introduced with **graphical user interfaces** and **Desktop Publishing** in the 1980s: the idea that while designing a document on a computer, it will look on the screen exactly like it will later look in print.

###X 

#####XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) 
A version of **HTML** built on the basis of **XML*. It generally has the same **markup** as HTML, but a stricter **syntax** that conforms to XML rules. XHTML was intended to supersede standard HTML for the Web, but hasn't been widely adopted. Instead, the competing format **HTML5** won and has been become the new standard.

#####XML (Extensible Markup Language) 
XML is markup language for constructing **markup** languages. It provides, in other words, a **syntax** in which specific markup languages can be built. (Based on XML, one could for example define a specific markup language for restaurant menus, for work schedules, or for poetry books, each of them containing self-defined custom **tags**.) A markup language constructed with XML, for example, is **XHTML**. **EPUB** internally uses the XML-compliant "Open Packaging Format" for cataloguing the different source files (text chapters, images etc.) used in an ebook.
