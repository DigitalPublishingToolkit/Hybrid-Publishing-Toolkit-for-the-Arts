#10 Glossary of technical terms 


###A 

#####Acronym 
An acronym is a shortened version of a phrase, often based on the first letter of each word. For example, WYSIWYG is the acronym for 'What You See Is What You Get'. 

#####Amazon 
A well-known online retailer of various goods, including print books and ebooks. Amazon also produces the Kindle and Kindle Fire e-reader devices. 

#####Anchor 
An anchor is a specific location within a HTML web page that can be jumped to by clicking on a hyperlink. 

#####Android 
An Open Source operating system for mobile phones and tablets, based on a Linux kernel and the Java programming language. Android is currently the most widely used operating system for  mobile devices. 

#####Animated GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) 
A graphic file that consists of two or more images shown in a timed sequence to give the effect of motion. 

#####API (Application Programming Interface) 
An interface between an operating system and application software that specifies how the two should communicate with each other. 

#####Application or app 
A software program, or integrated collection or programs, for mobile or desktop operating systems. Mobile apps are often distributed through an app store (Google Play store, Apple App Store). 

#####App store 
An online store where mobile applications may be bought or obtained for free. Every major mobile operating system also has its own storefront for mobile apps - App Store (Apple), Google Play, Amazon Appstore, Windows Phone Store and BlackBerry App World. 

#####ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) 
A standard way of encoding uppercase and lowercase letters in the English alphabet, as well as numbers and a number of special characters. ASCII uses only seven bits and is therefore limited to 128 characters. 

#####AZW (Amazon Word) 
A file format used by Amazon for its Kindle range of e-reader devices and software applications. See also **KF8** and **MOBI**.


###B 

#####Bandwidth 
Literally, the frequency width of a transmission channel, expressed in hertz, kilohertz, megahertz, etc. Often used as an expression of the amount of data that can be sent through a circuit. The higher the bandwidth, the greater the amount of data that can travel within a given time period. 

#####Binary 
A numeral system used in computing, based on a representation for numbers using only two digits (0 and 1). Computers use this because they can only recognize these two values, 1 or 0. This is simulated electronically by using a device, such as a switch, which is either on (1) or off (0). All numbers are represented by combinations of ones and zeroes. For example, the number 9 is represented as 1001. 

#####Bit 
Contraction of *binary digit*. A bit is the smallest measurement unit of computer memory or data transmission speed. 

#####BitTorrent 
BitTorrent is a protocol for the practice of peer-to-peer file sharing and is used for distributing large amounts of data over the Internet. 

#####Blog 
Short for web log; usually a chronological and often personal record of thoughts, web links, events, or actions posted on the Web. 

#####Browser 
Software that will load and display a web page. A browser interprets the HTML or XML code from the web page files, executes embedded scripts and programs, provides encryption/decryption for security where needed, displays graphics, plays music and video, and provides links to related pages. Browsers are based on standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. The major browser software developers participate in these standards, but each of these developers also builds in their own proprietary codes, whether or not they are approved; such differences create a challenge for web page developers. 

#####Browser extension 
Plugins to extend or enhance the inner workings of a web browser. 

#####Byte 
A measurement of computer memory or storage capacity. A byte comprises 8 *bits*. 


###C 

#####Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
Cascading Style Sheets are a feature that enables a range of styles for headings, body text, bullet points, links etc., to be specified for hypertext documents (HTML and XML, and by extension also EPUB). This makes it possible to set up a CSS file containing a library of styles that are used throughout a website or publication, thereby making it easier to ensure consistency. If a style needs to be changed throughout a website it only needs to be changed once in the CSS file and then it will be applied automatically. 

#####Compatibility 
Pieces of hardware and/or software which can be used together are described as compatible. 

#####Compressed files 
Compression is a technique for making a file or a data stream smaller for faster transmission, or to take up less storage space. An example is EPUB, which is a compressed collection of HTML files. Various software programs will compress and decompress files, such as PKZIP, WinZip, Stuffit, GNU gzip, and many more. Files with the following extensions are almost always compressed files: arc, arj, epub, gz, lha, lhz, taz, tgz, Z, zip, and zoo. 

#####Computer program 
A set of instructions that the computer carries out in sequence to perform a given task. Programs are usually written in English-like programming languages (e.g. C, Pascal, Java, C++), and are then converted into binary machine instructions by special software known as a compiler or an interpreter. Almost all modern software applications consist of collections of programs working together to perform assorted tasks. 

#####Content Management System (CMS) 
A software package that makes it possible for non-technical users to publish and manage content (text, images, etc.) on a website. 


###D 

#####Data 
Data is information in a form that can be processed by a computer. It is usually distinguished from a *computer program*, which is a set of instructions that a computer carries out. Data can be text or sets of figures on which a computer program operates. 

#####Database 
A set of structured data from which one can select specific records or a collection of records, often in a computer-readable and -accessible format. 

#####Dataset
A dataset (or data set) is a collection of data. 

#####Decompress 
See **Compressed files**. 

#####Desktop Publishing (DTP) 
The practice of designing printed matter on a personal computer, often using software like Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress. 

#####Device 
In the context of mobile computing, an electronic handheld apparatus such as a smartphone, tablet, phablet, personal digital assistant (PDA) or portable gaming device (PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Vita). 

#####Digital Rights Management (DRM) 
Technology used by publishers to regulate the usage of copyright-protected digital materials (MP3s, EPUBs, games, etc.). The practice of adding DRM to media is controversial, as it often makes it harder for paying customers to freely interact with the digital goods they have purchased. For example, files cannot in general be freely transferred to other devices. Also, accessing these files without an active Internet connection often proves difficult. 

#####Directory 
See **Folder**. 

#####Dots Per Inch (DPI) 
A measure of the quality of output, i.e. the number of dots per square inch produced by a printer or scanner, also referred to as its resolution. A resolution of at least 300 dpi is considered reasonable for the production of high-quality output by a printer and 1200 dpi by a scanner, but modern printers and scanners can produce much higher resolutions. The resolution of a scanner may also be expressed by two numbers. These are mostly the same, say 1200x1200, but you may also see 1200x2400, which means that the number of horizontal dots is different from the number of vertical dots. See also **Resolution**. 


###E 

#####Ebook 
A digital publication which can be read by e-readers and other handheld devices as well as desktop computers. There are various ebook formats such as EPUB and AZW. 

#####EPUB (Electronic Publication) 
An ebook format developed by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). EPUB has been designed to accommodate reflowable content. 

#####E-paper 
Electrophoretic paper, a display technology consisting of electrostatically charged particles that are made to turn either black or white according to the polarity of the charge. Electricity is only used for refreshing ('turning') the page, thereby considerably reducing power consumption and making the technology ideal for reading long texts. The display is not backlit like the LCD screens used in tablets, smartphones and personal computers, therefore it must be illuminated externally like actual paper. The upside is that it can be read in broad daylight without any loss of image quality. Since the refresh rate is much slower than LCD screens, the technology does not allow for videos or animations. 

#####E-reader 
A device capable of reading digital texts in various formats, notably EPUB and AZW. 


###F 

#####File 
A file is an object for storing information in an electronic system such as a computer. A file can contain text and formatting created with a word processor, an image, a video, a computer program, etc. Each file has a name that can be used to locate it and describe its contents, and is stored in a certain location, known as a folder or directory. 

#####File extension 
A method used by many operating systems including Windows and Mac OS X to determine the format of a file based on the end of its name: the letters following the final period. This portion of the filename is known as the filename extension. For example, HTML documents are identified by names that end with .html (or .htm), and GIF images by .gif. In the past, names were limited to an eight-character identifier and a three-character extension. There are only a limited number of three-letter extensions, so a given extension may apply to more than one format. Many formats still use three-character extensions, even though modern operating systems and application programs no longer have this limitation. There is no standard list of extensions. 

#####File permissions 
Files stored on a computer usually have 'permissions' defining which users are allowed to read, amend or (in the case of a program file) execute them. This is important for example in a school, college or university network environment, where teachers and lecturers may have the permission to amend certain files, for example documents that they have created, but students are only allowed to read them. File permissions are usually determined by network managers. 

#####Folder 
A location on a disc containing *files* and *subfolders* grouped together for organizational purposes. The term is used synonymously with 'directory', which has become a less common term since the introduction of operating systems with graphical user interfaces. Subfolders are sometimes referred to as 'child folders' of the 'parent folder'. The topmost folder on a computer, which is the parent of all folders on the disc, is known as the 'root folder'. 

#####Formatting 
The process of applying styling (bold, italic, etc.) to text. Another meaning can be: the process of preparing a writeable disc for use. 

#####Freemium 
A revenue model in which the basic product or service (typically a digital product such as software, media, games or web services) is provided free of charge, but money (a premium) is charged for extra features, functionality, or virtual goods. 


###G 

#####GitHub 
A digital platform for code review, code management and collaboration for Open Source and private projects. 

#####Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
Software that allows human users to interact with a computer or other digital device in a visual way, as opposed to text-based command-line interfaces. A GUI features graphical elements such as icons, windows and mouse pointers. By manipulating these elements, the user can run programs and carry out other operations such as copying information, deleting files, etc. 

#####Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) 
A file format used for storing simple graphics. GIF files use a palette of up to 256 colors, which makes them a good choice for logos, line drawings, icons, etc., but unsuitable for photographs and full-color artworks. The more colors of the palette are used, the larger the GIF file will be. GIF files are commonly used for storing images on the Web and are also suitable for storing animated (moving) images, see **Animated GIF**. See also **JPEG**.


###H 

#####HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
A markup standard used mainly for creating pages on the World Wide Web. HTML allows the author or designer to define the layout and formatting of the page, add audio-visual material, insert hypertext links, etc. HTML is based on the older standard SGML, which stands for Standardized General Markup Language. 

#####HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) 
The transfer method (protocol) used on the World Wide Web for transmitting and receiving web pages. 

#####Hybrid Publishing 
Hybrid publishing is the publishing of one single publication in several different print and electronic media, preferably with a workflow that minimizes the effort of customizing the publication for each medium. 

#####Hyperlink 
A hyperlink (hypertext link) is a method of referencing data used extensively in media such as web pages and ebooks. By clicking on the hyperlink, the user is led to another part of the document, or to a different document, web page or website. Hyperlinks are usually highlighted and/or underlined so that users can easily recognize them in the text. See also **Hypertext**. 

#####Hypertext 
A system for the non-sequential presentation of text, and arguably the fundamental underlying principle of the World Wide Web. The concept of hypertext predates the Web by many years. See also **Hyperlink**. 


###I 

#####iBooks 
A software application which allows users to purchase, read and manage ebooks. Developed by Apple for its iOS and Mac OS X operating systems. 

#####Icon 
A small symbol or picture used in a graphical user interface (GUI). The icons on the computer screen represent programs or files. For example, a picture of a painter's palette may be used to represent software used for drawing and editing pictures, and a picture of a book with a question mark on its cover may represent the text of a user manual or a help file. 

#####Incompatibility 
See **Compatibility**. 

#####Interactivity 
Used to describe the ways in which software accepts and responds to user input. 

#####Interface 
An interface is a hardware or software connection between two systems, or between a system and a human user. For example, the physical hardware interface between a computer and a printer, or the software interface for transferring data and commands between two software programs or applications. The software and hardware interface that allows a human user to communicate with a computer is also known as a user interface. See also **Graphical user interface**. 

#####Internet 
The Internet, or simply 'the Net', is a computer network connecting millions of computers all over the world. It provides communications to governments, businesses, universities, schools, and homes. Any modern computer can be connected to the Internet using existing communications systems. Schools and universities normally access the Internet via their own educational networks, but private individuals usually have to take out a subscription with a service provider. Although the Internet is in fact a network of networks, it appears to users as a network of individual computers. The Internet dates back to the group of interconnected networks that evolved from the ARPANET of the late 60s and early 70s. It has grown from a handful of interconnected networks into a huge network of millions of computers. 

#####iOS 
Mobile operating system, originally called iPhone OS until June 2010, which runs on the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV. 


###J 

#####JavaScript 
JavaScript is a scripting language originally developed by Netscape, mainly for use as executable code within web pages. JavaScript is very popular for common tasks such as validating data entry forms within a web page before they are submitted to the server. JavaScript can also alter the way a page looks by dynamically changing CSS format settings within the web page. JavaScript is not the same as Java, which is a high-level programming language. 

#####JPEG or JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) 
A file format used for storing images. The JPEG format uses a palette of millions of colors and is primarily intended for photographs and full-color artworks. Unlike the GIF format, the JPEG format is a 'lossy' format, meaning that data is compressed according to a mathematical model involving a trade-off between file size and image quality. For full-color images, the JPEG format in practice yields better results, yet with smaller file sizes, than the GIF format. 


###K 

#####KF8 
KF8 is the latest ebook format used by Amazon for its Kindle hardware. See also **AZW** and **MOBI**. 

#####Kindle 
Amazon's Kindle is a range of handheld e-reader devices and companion software applications for reading ebooks, particularly in Amazon's proprietary AZW, KF8 and MOBI ebook formats. The more recent Kindle Fire is not so much an e-reader as a full-fledged, small-sized tablet. 

#####Kobo 
Kobo is a company that produces a range of handheld e-reader devices and software. It also has its own storefront where users can purchase ebooks (mainly in the EPUB format). 


###L 

#####LaTeX 
A document markup language used mainly in scientific documents. LaTeX is particularly useful for rendering typographically complex mathematical formulas. 

#####Layout
The overall visual design of a document. In the case of printed matter, layout includes elements such as page dimensions and margins, font type and size, markup formatting, the placement of various elements within the page, and various other elements such as headings and page numbers. In the case of reflowable documents such as ebooks, the layout must be adapted to take into account the fact that different devices or applications will render the layout in different ways. 

#####LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) 
The technology used for producing the flat-panel display screens found on most contemporary computers, tablets and smartphones as well as other devices such as digital cameras. Currently, a 'new improved' technology known as TFT LCD (Thin Film Transistor LCD) is gradually becoming the industry standard. <!-- Florian maybe you can check this, I don't really know enough about this. Joe  -->

###M 

#####Markdown 
A simple markup language which uses common symbols such as #, * and _ to define various style attributes. See also the more powerful extension **MultiMarkdown**. 

#####Markup
A standard system of codes inserted in a text-based document to define formatting instructions (such as bold, italics, etc.), structuring instructions (such as chapters, headings, references, etc.) and various other elements such as images, hyperlinks, etc. These elements will be processed by software in order to properly render the document as intended by the author or designer. 

#####Markup language 
A clearly defined system of markup elements. As with human languages, each markup language has its own rules of grammar and syntax. 

#####Metadata 
Standardized descriptors of data in a particular document (author, creation date, etc.)

#####Monitor 
The screen on which the output from a computer is displayed. Also referred to as display screen. 

#####Monochrome 
Monochrome images are either in one color (black and white) or shades of one color (grayscale).  

#####MP3 (MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III)
A common audio encoding compression format for digital audio. Though MP3 was developed in the 1990s, it has not (yet) been superseded  by newer and technically superior compression formats such as MP4 AAC. 

#####MP4 / MPEG-4 
A common encoding format for digital video (MP4 AVC) and audio (MP4 AAC). The MP4 AAC audio format is best known as the default audio format for Apple's iPod, iPhone and iPad devices, as well as its iTunes storefront and media player. The MP4 AVC video format is increasingly popular for storing video on mobile devices. 

#####MultiMarkdown 
An extension of the markup language Markdown, with additional support for footnotes, tables, mathematical formulas, cross-references, bibliographies and definition lists. 
 
#####Multimedia 
The integration of two or more types of information (text, images, audio, video, animation, etc.) in a single application. 


###O 

#####OCR (Optical Character Recognition) 
OCR software is used in conjunction with a scanner to convert pages of printed text into a digital format such as ASCII or Unicode. 

#####Open Source 
Originally, the term 'Open Source' was used to describe a development model based on universal access to the human-readable 'source code' of software, in contrast with the prevalent industry practice of protecting this code as a trade secret and distributing only the 'executable' machine code which could not be deciphered by casual users. More recently the term is increasingly being used to describe similar practices in other fields such as design, engineering and even medicine. 

#####Operating system (OS) 
Software that manages the computer's hardware and software resources, provides collections of tools and services used by software applications, and regulates the user interface. Well-known operating systems include Windows, Linux, Mac OS X as well as mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS. 


###P 

#####PDA (Personal Digital Assistant)
A handheld device featuring information management functions such as an agenda, a list of contacts and web browsing. PDAs became obsolete with the introduction of smartphones. 

#####PDF (Portable Document Format) 
PDF was originally developed by Adobe Systems as a format for sharing documents across otherwise incompatible operating systems and platforms while ensuring consistency of all layout elements. Since 2008, PDF is an open standard. PDF files can be viewed on any device that has appropriate software installed (such as the free but proprietary Adobe Reader). PDF is a fixed-layout (as opposed to reflowable) document format. 

#####Pixel 
All text and images on a display screen are made up of a grid of thousands (or even millions) of small colored dots known as pixels. The term 'pixel' is derived from 'picture element'. See also **Resolution**. 

#####Plain text 
Text without any visual formatting such as bold, italic, font types and sizes, clickable hyperlinks, etc. 

#####Platform 
A generic term used in various contexts to describe technology which serves as a foundation upon which other technology can be built. For example, an operating system can be considered a platform, or the term can apply more broadly to a combination of hardware and software. Platform-independent software is software that can (theoretically) be run on any computer. 

#####Print On Demand (POD) 
Print on demand (POD) is a digital printing technology in which a book or other publication is printed in the exact amount of copies required at the moment. The POD model in this sense deviates from traditional printing, where large quantities of books are produced in initial print runs to reduce costs prior to distribution. The emergence of POD has had a huge impact on the publishing industry by allowing authors to self-publish at very low costs. Print on demand is sometimes also called publish on demand. 

#####Program 
See **Computer program**.

#####Protocol 
In Internet terminology, a protocol usually refers to a set of rules that define an exact format for communication between systems. For example, the HTTP protocol defines the format for communication between web browsers and web servers. 

<!-- note to Florian: I have not yet made it further than here --->


###R 

#####Reflowable 
A reflowable document is a type of electronic document that can adapt its presentation to the output device. 

#####Resolution 
A measure of the number of pixels or small dots displayed on a computer display screen, printer or scanner. One normally talks in terms of the quality of resolution, using the expression low-resolution, medium-resolution and high-resolution. The resolution of a computer display screen is normally expressed as two numbers representing the horizontal and vertical resolution, i.e. dots across each line of the screen and down each line of the screen: e.g. 640 x 480, 1024 x 768, etc. The resolution of a printer is normally referred to by the number of dots per inch (dpi) - i.e. square inch. 

#####Rich Text Format (RTF) 
An alternative way of storing a document created with a Microsoft Word-processor. RTF formatted files can be moved relatively easily between different computer systems. RTF files preserve most of the formatting contained in doc-formatted files. 


###S 

#####Server-side scripting 
Server-side scripting is used is a web server technique where a user's request is fulfilled by running a script directly on the web server to generate dynamic web pages. 

#####Software Development Kit (SDK) 
A collection of documented tools and services for developers in order to create applications for certain operating systems or web platforms. 

#####Streaming 
Playing audio or video in real time from a website. In order to play streaming multimedia files you need a specific plug-in program that links in with your browser and plays the file as it is transmitted rather than downloading it to your computer first. Streaming requires a broadband connection to the Internet since multimedia files are not stored on your computer but played in a continuous stream direct from the computer where they are stored. 

#####Style sheet
A style sheet is a sheet summarizing the editorial conventions to be followed in preparing text for publication.

#####Syntax 
The correct 'grammar' and 'spelling' of a markup language, command line, programming language, etc. 


###T 

#####Tablet 
A tablet is compact portable computer that makes use of a touchscreen instead of a keyboard for typing and running applications. Apple's iPad is a typical example of a tablet computer. 

#####Tagging 
Tags are small alpha-numeric indicators around a word or part of text to define the role and/or function of that text. It is an essential tool in XML and HTML. Tagging has become more common in recent years as a result of the widespread use of social media for sharing images, audio recordings, video recordings, website references, etc. Tags are labels that briefly describe the what the media or references are all about and help other people find them quickly. 

#####Text editor 
A computer program that allow the manipulation of text. 

#####TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) 
A file format for storing raster graphics, commonly used in print design. 
 
#####Tumblr 
Tumblr is a micro blogging system, as well as a social networking site. Mainly used for sharing images. 


###U 

#####Unicode 
The Unicode worldwide character standard is a character coding system designed to support the interchange, processing, and display of the written texts of the diverse languages of the modern world. In addition, it supports classical and historical texts of many written languages. 

#####Unix 
An operating system widely used on large computer systems in corporations and universities, on which many web servers are hosted. A PC version of Unix, called Linux, is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to Windows. 


###W 

#####Word processor 
Probably the most widely used computer application, success as Microsoft Word, Apple's Pages, and Open Source software OpenOffice. Modern word processors allow the user to create fine-looking documents including images, tables, photographs, and even sound and video recordings if they are to be viewed on screen rather than from the printed page. In many respects they are similar to desktop publishing applications. Word processors normally include a spellchecker, a grammar checker, a style checker and a thesaurus, as well as tools for writing in HTML, the coding language used for producing web pages. 

#####WWW (World Wide Web) 
Usually referred to simply as the Web. This is the most powerful and fastest growing Internet service. The World Wide Web was the brainchild of Tim Berners-Lee, who in 1989 invented the HTML coding language that is the basis of the Web. The Web became a public service in 1993. It is a huge collection of resources of information, including learning materials, which is accessed by means of a computer program known as a browser. The World Wide Web is only part of the Internet, but many people treat both terms as synonyms. 

#####WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) 
A concept used to describe the notion that the appearance of text and images onscreen, corresponds more or less directly with the way the finished product (web page, printed document, etc.) will appear. 


###X 

#####XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) 
A markup language mainly used to produce websites. It generally has the same characteristics as HTML, but has a stricter syntax which allow it to be easily read by an XML-parser. 

#####XML (Extensible Markup Language) 
XML is a specification emanating from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows web designers to create their own language for displaying documents on the Web. XML is an extension to the standard language for creating web pages, HTML, and makes it possible to create websites containing more complex interactivity.
