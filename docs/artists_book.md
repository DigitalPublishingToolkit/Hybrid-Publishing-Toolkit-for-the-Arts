# Artist's/designer's book

Lately, artists' and designer's books have grown from a niche phenomenon to a major genre within arts and design publishing. It could be argued that the book as an art or design object in its own right has become more prominent now that the function of the book as a simple carrier of information (such as in a telephone directory, a dictionary or a run-of-the-mill novel or non-fiction paperback) is increasingly taken over by the World Wide Web and by e-readers. 

The history of artists' books - or "bookworks", as the Mexican-Dutch writer and visual artist Ulises Carri처n called them[^1] - is often traced to the beginnings concrete poetry, Fluxus and conceptual art, and the artists' books (and book-like objects) made among others by Dieter Roth and Ed Ruscha. But one could just as well include the Bauhaus book series ("Bauhausb체cher") of the 1920s, earlier Dadaist and Futurist pamphlets and self-published books, the books made in the 19th century Arts and Crafts movement and even 16th century illustrated books like Sebastian Brant's and Albrecht D체rer's "Ship of Fools" that were crafted in workshop collaborations between writers, visual artists and printmakers.

The common denominator of these books is that they defy easy categorization and genre characteristics. This makes it difficult to give standard recommendations for their design as electronic books. On the other hand, contemporary artists, designers and media activists were among the first to experiment with electronic publishing:
- In the 1980s and early 1990s, many makers of zines (do-it-yourself small press periodicals) became makers of _e-zines_, electronic zines that used dial-up computer bulletin boards and the Internet as noncommercial samizdat media. Their typical publication format were simple plain text files. Many e-zines worked around their technical limitations with ASCII art, typograms as they had also been produced in 1960s and 70s concrete poetry on typewriters, and with homebrew formatting codes ("_" for underlines, "#" for headlines etc.), the immediate precursors of the Markdown format described here in this toolkit.
- In the early 1990s, there also existed a hacker culture of "disk mags" for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST home computers. These electronic magazines were anonymously published on floppy disks and were based on self-written computer programs (factually, early "apps") that displayed their animated text and visual contents.
- Since the late 1990s, there have been a number of artist-run sites - textz.com, ubu.com, aaaaarg.org, monoskop.org - that offer free downloads of cultural theory and arts-related books, typically in simple formats such as plain text, PDF and epub.
