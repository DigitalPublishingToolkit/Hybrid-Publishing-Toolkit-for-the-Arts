# 09 Guide: Alternative ways of publishing
<!-- This is a draft chapter and should be extended with a guide on how to create an EPUB using Adobe InDesign CC -->

A single downloadable package like EPUB might be a great vehicle to monetise, but there could be other factors to consider when publishing. A consistent design and uniform interactivity across devices could be a requirement, in which case a reflowable document might not be the ideal solution. Some publishers opt to develop their own (mobile) applications, like The Guardian's iOS version of their newspaper, the amplified ebooks by Penguin or the children's book by Purple Carrot. [^guardian-ios] [^penguin-amplified] [^purple-carrot-publication] These solutions offer fine-grained control over user interaction and consistency of design, but come with the extra cost of hiring a development team to engineer the application. Also, publishing for different platforms is not that straightforward. Code written specifically with the iOS SDK (Software Development Kit) in mind will likely require a lot of editing before it's ready to run on the Android platform. Portability is another issue, it's fairly easy to transfer an EPUB to another device, however application binaries are not that easily passed around, mostly due to the relatively closed nature of mobile operating systems.

Lastly, why not just publish essays, articles or even whole books on a website? The wealth of weblogs and other publishing platforms shows that this is a viable form of publishing. Monetising is less straightforward, most websites generate income by showing advertisements or sponsored articles. Paid membership is also used as a business model by some websites, like *De Correspondent*. One of the major downsides is that content will only be available online and cannot be easily passed around as a single unit of information like an EPUB or a PDF.


##Authoring Suites
A range of publishing suites is available as well, which roughly fall into two categories. One can be described as full-blown editors, the other allows publishers to enhance existing publications with interactive features.

###Editors: calibre, Sigil, iBooks Author
Both Sigil and iBooks Author follow a paradigm closely related to DTP applications like Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress. Designing a page layout and templates is primarily done via a WYSIWYG drag-and-drop interface and text is mostly edited inline.

Calibre is both a ebook management application, but in recent versions it also has the tools necessary to edit or create ebooks. [^calibre-edit-ebooks] Calibre's editor is similar to a traditional text editor with a live preview on the side. Using the editor the user interacts directly with the code of the separate pages in an ebook.

###Enhancers: Adobe Digital Publishing Suite, Mag+
These applications mostly integrate (as plugins) in an existing Adobe InDesign and allow designers to define interactive content (media, animations, etc.) in a traditional print design. As such these tools are often used to convert print magazines into their digital counterparts suitable for sale in Apple's Newsstand, for example.
