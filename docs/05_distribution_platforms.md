# 05 Distribution platforms 
 
## Ebook stores: Amazon, Apple, Google, Kobo, Sony 
 
Many channels exist for distributing ebooks. Curiously, most traditional retailers (large bookshops, like Libris or AKO in the Netherlands) play a marginal role in the selling of electronic publications, with the exception of a company like Barnes & Noble with their range of NOOK devices and associated storefront. Large players in the field include Amazon, Apple, Google, Barnes & Noble and Kobo. 
 
The aforementioned storefronts typically charge a percentage for each publication sold, this percentage generally is no less than 30% of the retail price.[^apple-press-percentage]^,^[^guardian-amazon-hachette] Apart from Google, most of the larger retailers offer tight integration with their own branded e-reader hardware (Kindle, iPad, NOOK, etc.) For example, publications bought on a Kindle via the Amazon Store are immediately downloaded to the device for further use, without hooking the device up to a computer and transferring the purchases manually. 
 
Each retailer accepts a different set of publications. Apple for example doesn't allow the sale of PDFs in its bookstore and only supports EPUB or publications made using iBooks Author.[^apple-publication-guidelines] Amazon, via their Kindle Direct Publishing program, supports a wider range of publications formats, including AZW, EPUB, PDF and even Microsoft Word documents.[^kindle-direct-publishing] 
 
## Online reading platforms: Issuu, Scribd, Internet Archive, website/blog 
 
Online reading platforms are browser-based platforms where digital publications are uploaded and made available. The publication can be presented in different formats. The choice for an online platform and the accompanying publication format also has effect on modes and reach of distribution. 
 
When using an online reading platform, publishers effectively become dependent on the platform provider. If the platform changes its technology, terms of service or goes out of business, the publisher will be out of control. Online reading platforms typically create a higher degree of dependence and vendor-lock-in than classical ebookstores that distribute downloadable files (and where it is easier for a publisher to make those files on an alternative download/shop platform). 
 
Below several platforms are discussed, including characteristics, statistics, strengths and weaknesses, and how-to-publish (Issuu [^Issuu], Scribd [^Scribd] and Internet Archive [^Internet-Archive])

###Social reading platforms 
 
Social reading has to do with the experience of reading ebooks. It is a field in great development, which lies beyond the scope of this Toolkit. However, it is good for publishers working on e-publications to keep an eye on the future of social reading. 
 
Examples of social reading platforms: 
 
- *Goodreads* ('Goodreads is the world's largest site for readers and book recommendations. Our mission is to help people find and share books they love. Goodreads launched in January 2007.') 
- *Social Book* ('Social Book, created by the Institute for the Future of the Book, is a social reading platform that allows reader to add their own commentary to texts, share these ideas with others, follow others' comments, and create communities of interactive reader/writers.') 
- *Wattpad* ('Wattpad stories are free. Whether you're online or off, use the devices you already own to carry an entire library wherever you go.' 'Join the conversation about the stories you read: message the writer and interact with other people who love the story as much as you.') 
- *Hebban* (A Dutch social reading platform that released in beta version in 2014) 
- *Social media discussions* are also part of the social reading experience. One can think here of Twitter interviews or when a book is being discussed online by a publisher. 
 
 
## Print on demand 
 
There are a lot of options for **print-on-demand** publishing. A simple Google query will return a myriad of services. Below are discussed the most important ones, international and Dutch.

## Pirate platforms: AAAAARG, Monoskop, The Pirate Bay, library.ru 
As with music and films, 'pirate' platforms haven often been the avant-garde of electronic publishing. They provide music, films, games and electronic books as free downloads - either in outright copyright violation or in gray zones (when, for example, providing obscure and out-of-print books, films or recordings whose rights owners are unknown). Whether one likes it or not, pirate platforms have best met customer demand. Often, they are user friendlier than many Internet shops. The mere existence and popularity of pirate sites for digitized book shows, by the way, how large the market for electronic reading really is. Pirate platforms are, by their nature, even more volatile than online bookstores and e-reading platforms. Worldwide, many organizations exist aiming to combat piracy and shut down facilitators of said practice, even when operating on a small scale. As a general rule pirate platforms have proven to be mostly resistant to the crackdown attempts by copyright enforcers, often reincarnating on a different web domain shortly after a forced closure. 
 
Commercial providers of digital content can learn a lot from the pirates. Netflix,[^Netflix] the most successful web service for **streaming** films and growing competitor for pay TV, is known for buying films based on their popularity on The Pirate Bay.[^The-Pirate-Bay] 
 
#### All-purpose download sites 
Sites like The Pirate Bay offer all kinds of media for download: films, music, computer games and software, and electronic books. Since they are widely used, display current download statistics and since their technology (BitTorrent) depend on user participation for their downloads to stay alive, they can provide great insight into what is really popular among readers. 
 
The content listed on The Pirate Bay and other sites for the BitTorrent **protocol** tends to be mainstream: Hollywood films, pop music, and a tendency towards non-fiction and technical handbook literature alongside fantasy and science fiction among the ebook downloads. For example, on a particular day and minute in June 2014, the book 'Atlas of Ancient Worlds' had more than 2000 downloads in 48 hours. In comparison, the most popular film - an episode of the TV series 'Game of Thrones' - had more than 70000 downloads. 
 
 
#### General ebook sites 
 
The most simple pirate ebook sites offer any kind of book - very much like a large all-audience book store or Amazon.com's online bookstores. They are little more than a simple search engine that spits out downloadable ebooks. These types of sites have become particularly popular in Russia. At the time of this writing, library.ru has been the model for this kind of site and, after its crackdown, it was superseded by bookfi.org.[^bookfi.org] Also libgen.info,[^libgen.info] an online library, is an example to mention here. 
 
What online booksellers could learn from these sites: 
 
* Simplicity combined with encyclopedic scope. With no other site except Amazon's, it is as easy to find and download an electronic book, no matter which genre, language, whether bestselling or obscure. 
* Simplicity in formats. The sites provide mostly PDFs as well as EPUBs, depending on whatever file format they have available (and obtained from hacker networks). 
 
#### Specialized sites 
 
Some websites outside or in gray areas of copyright are artistic projects. In the 1990s, 'textz.com' by the Berlin-based artist Sebastian Luetgert was the first site to offer cultural, political and media theory books as simple, gratis-downloadable text files - among them, theory classics by Theodor W. Adorno. The name 'textz' was a pun on 'warez', a slang name for illegally copied software. Later, the websites aaaaarg.org[^aaaaarg.org] and Monoskop[^Monoskop] provided related collections of freely downloadable art, cultural and media studies books, yet with different thematic emphases: to stimulate reading and discussion groups, or to provide a carefully hand-selected library mirroring the taste of the site owner. 
 
Best known, and factually legendary, is UbuWeb,[^Ubuweb] an encyclopedic site providing downloadable sound, video and text file version of avant-garde arts records, films and books. Most of them fall under the category of small edition artists' books, and are provided with the artists' permission - since most these works never created revenue when they were commercially released. 
 
All these sites run like small specialty bookstores (although they don't sell anything). They show that the opposite of Amazon and bookfi.org can work as well, namely the personal selection and combination of books. If they are as strong as in the case of UbuWeb and Monoskop, they create their own public that will download a work not because of having heard of it or of the author, but because being on such a particular site is recommendation enough. 
 
 
 
 
## Artist-/designer-run projects: Badlands Unlimited, KYUR8, artists ebooks 
 
In the last couple of years, there have been first attempts to create only small presses and book download stores for [artists' and designer's books](#artistdesigner-book): writer, artist and publisher, James Bridle (who coined the term 'new aesthetics') created the website 'artistsebooks.org' with freely downloadable EPUB files by experimental writers and artists. American contemporary artist and designer Paul Chan initiated the more commercial online press Badlands Unlimited that sells artist-made visual electronic books that are proprietary to the iPad and Apple's iBooks platform. The iPhone/iPad app 'KYUR8' (slang riff on 'curate') invites artists' to quickly make their own electronic visual zines using page templates and user's cell phone photo collections. Other examples are [http://www.gauss-pdf.com](http://www.gauss-pdf.com), a publisher of digital and print works and [http://trollthread.tumblr.com](http://trollthread.tumblr.com), a collective of poets that produces publications available for download in PDF or purchase as print on demand volumes. 
 
None of these projects compete with classical ebook stores, online reading platforms or even specialist pirate sites. They are, after all, experimental projects and artists' portfolio pieces.
