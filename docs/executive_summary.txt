# Executive summary

"You must change your life" - borrowing from philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, this is our burdensome message for all publishers, writers, editors and designers working in the field of arts- and design-oriented publishing who want to transition towards electronic publishing or hybrid print and electronic publishing. At least you will need to change your life if electronic publishing will not merely be an afterthought in your production chain and product portfolio, but become just as important as print.

In short, the transition will require a rethinking of traditional publication formats, a rethinking of editorial and production workflows, and last not least a rethinking of distribution. This even will be the case if your publication won't drastically change its form and content in the electronic medium. For arts and design publications however, the challenge of going electronic can be even greater than for other fields of publishing for a number of reasons: 
- visually oriented publications are still more difficult to technically realize in the electronic medium when designing for a multitude of different reading devices and platforms;
- small publishers are under even higher pressures to keep projects within reasonable costs;
- small editions make it necessary that electronic publications are sustainable:  they should not need constant investment into technical maintenance and version updates.

These factors often amount to a huge contrast between computer industry promises and the reality of the new medium. On the one hand, publishers, editors, designers and artists overestimate interactive and multimedia opportunities of electronic publishing. These possibilities do exist, but tend be more expensive and specific to particular technical reading platforms - why and how is explained here in detail. On the other hand, publishers often underestimate that even technically simple and seemingly banal types of electronic publications can force a rethinking of traditional publishing formats (such as: the anthology, the catalogue, the periodical). 

Last not least, but perhaps most importantly, going electronic - or going hybrid -

They also tend to underestimate the necessities of changing editorial processes and technical workflows. 

This is especially true when electronic publications are no longer produced experimentally, as separate (sometimes costly) design projects outsourced to external design teams, but as
