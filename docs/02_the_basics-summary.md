- In the historical development of writing, non-letter characters have become increasingly important: first blank spaces between words, then punctuation marks, later formatting **markup**.
- In electronic texts, markup has developed into two general types: visual-typographic (such as in the tag “bold type”) versus logical-semantic (such as in the tag “emphasis”).
- Logical-semantic markup is the basis for hybrid publishing since it can be translated into the visual formatting that is best fit for a particular medium.
- The main advantage of electronic books is that same content can be published in a wide variety of formats.
