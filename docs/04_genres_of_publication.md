# Genres of Publication

## Traditional forms of publication

In the present project we deal with various kinds of products which we combine into  five genres: 

 1) Art/design catalogue-like;  

 2) Research-like publication;  

 3) Art/design periodical;  

 4) Artist's/experimental book;  

 5) New types of publications.


###1) Art/design catalogue-like

- Heavy in use of images
- Visuals take central role over texts
- Visuals are primary (text refers to visuals)
- Descriptive texts of changing lengths

Issues and advantages of going electronic:  

One of the main issues which arise when trying to go electronic with Art/design catalogue-like publications lies in the use of images. The quality of the images is important. They must often be high in quality with as little distortion of colours as possible. An issue of concern is that often a fixed page layout determines the message. Changes in size might influence the flow of content. An advantage of going electronic with this type of publication could lie in the use of other (interactive) materials and easier distribution.  


###2) Research-like publication 

- Heavy in use of text
- Texts take a central role
- Visuals are secondary (images refer to texts)
- Often longer texts
- Often with a standardised structure

Issues and advantages of going electronic:  

One of the issues with going electronic with a research-like publication is setting parameters for the use of and interaction between text and images. Advantages of going electronic with this type of publication have to do with the wider reach and availability of the content. Making the text available digitally could increase its spreading. This is often a goal of research-like publications. Another advantage is that due to the high level of standardised structure a 'modularisation' of the content becomes possible thereby allowing to go beyond the traditional essay writing. In particular when authors refer to each other, they often share data, quotations, tables, figures, etc. Multiple use and reuse of 'modules' will enormously enhance the communication within a community.

###3) Art/design periodical

- Heavy in use of texts and images and mixtures of both
- Both images and texts take central role
- Use of images is both primary and secondary
- Texts of changing lengths
- A more-or-less fixed page-layout format
- Recurring publication format (e.g. magazines, series etc.)


Issues and advantages of going electronic:  

One of the issues with going digital with an art/design periodical lies in the limitations of the digital medium. The periodical thrives well by its physical presence. It can be tossed in a bag and just as easily be disposed of. In a digital form, the physical presence becomes limited. Another issue with going digital with an art/design periodical lies in the archival aspect. New articles can refer to older ones and even integrate parts. The periodical as such becomes a repository and therefore a playground for new work. An advantage of going electronic with this kind of periodical lies in the increased possibilities in extending content (interactivity, video etc.). Another specific advantage of the periodical lies in the decreasing of distribution costs and the convenience with which a large audience can be reached. 



###4)  Artist's/experimental books

- Book *by* an artist, rather than *about* an artist
- Complex use of images and typography, often pushing the possibilities of the medium
- In print: making use of the book as a material, visual and haptic object;
- Difficult or impossible translation into other media;
- Text is often used in non-descriptive or non-narrative ways.

An issue with making a digital publication out of an artist's/experimental book is the choice of material. The choice to go digital in this case is the most fundamental. Furthermore, here too, the quality of images and the relation between text and images is important. The choices which are being made by the creator influence the final outcome immensely. Advantages of going digital lie in the more extensive possibilities digitalization offers (e.g. interactive material etc.).

<!-- begin Florian's text -->

Lately, artists' and designer's books have grown from a niche phenomenon to a major genre within arts and design publishing. It could be argued that the book as an art or design object in its own right has become more prominent now that the function of the book as a generic carrier of information (such as in a telephone directory, a dictionary or a run-of-the-mill novel or non-fiction paperback) is increasingly taken over by the World Wide Web and by e-readers. 

The history of artists' books - or "bookworks", as the Mexican-Dutch writer and visual artist Ulises Carrión called them[^1] - is often traced to the beginnings of concrete poetry, Fluxus and conceptual art, and the artists' books (and book-like objects) made among others by Dieter Roth and Ed Ruscha. But one could just as well include the Bauhaus book series ("Bauhausbücher") of the 1920s, earlier Dadaist and Futurist pamphlets and self-published books, the books made in the 19th century Arts and Crafts movement and even 16th century illustrated books like Sebastian Brant's and Albrecht Dürer's "Ship of Fools" that were crafted in workshop collaborations between writers, visual artists and printmakers.

The common denominator of these books is that they defy easy categorization and genre characteristics, making it difficult to give standard recommendations for their design as electronic books. 

#### Transfer from paper to electronic?

The more medium-specific an artist's book is, the less sense it makes to translate it 1:1 into an electronic book. Dieter Roth's sculptural book objects, for example, would change from book art works to mere depictions of book art workds when reproduced electronically. 

On the other hand, many contemporary artists, designers and media activists experimented with electronic publishing as a "poor" (i.e. simple low tech) medium of social sharing rather than a "rich" visual and tactile medium:
- In the 1980s and early 1990s, many makers of zines (do-it-yourself small press periodicals) became makers of _e-zines_, electronic zines that used dial-up computer bulletin boards and the Internet as noncommercial samizdat media. Their typical publication format were simple plain text files. Many e-zines worked around their technical limitations by using ASCII art, typograms as they had also been produced in 1960s and 70s concrete poetry on typewriters, and with homebrew formatting codes ("_" for underlines, "#" for headlines etc.), the immediate precursors of the Markdown format described here in this toolkit.
- In the early 1990s, there also existed a hacker culture of "disk mags" for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST home computers. These electronic magazines were anonymously published on floppy disks and were based on self-written computer programs (factually, early "apps") that displayed their animated text and visual contents.
- Since the late 1990s, there have been a number of artist-run sites - textz.com, ubu.com, aaaaarg.org, monoskop.org - that offer free downloads of cultural theory and arts-related books, typically in simple formats such as plain text, PDF and epub.
In these examples, the focus is not on the book as a visual object, but on concepts and politics of its sharing and dissemination; in other words, artists' publishing as electronic samizdat. In such scenarios, artists' books as simple 1:1 transfers from print originals to electronic reproductions can make sense.

##### Technical solutions for samizdat publications

For such activist or minimalist projects, the lowest technical denominator and most easily readable file formats are advisable:
- plain text (ASCII) as the most simple, compatible and minimalist solution
- single-file HTML. It is possible to directly embed images into an HTML file (without providing them as separate files); technical instructions can be found [here](...).
- PDF. This format is widely readble and best suited for faithfully reproducing print books, but limited in its readability on different devices and hardly editable (more explanation [here](...)).
- epub. This format is factually just HTML for offline reading, with improved publication meta data and improved compatibility to e-readers. Projects can very easily be made and provided both in HTML and epub.
Since the design of most samizdat books does not differ from that of [research publications](...) or other visually simple publishing formats, no special design advice is necessary here, except the principle of "worse is better": the smaller the file size, the most compatible and universally readable the file format, the better, even if this comes at the expense of typographic and visual quality. An plain text files, then, might be preferable to a nicely designed PDF file. 

#### How to make visually oriented artists' books

##### Pre-history and general issues

There is, factually, a rich tradition of artists' audiovisual electronic books: It began in the 1990s with hypertext and interactive multimedia literary experiments on floppy disk, CD-ROMs, later web sites and mobile apps. The [Electronic Literature Organization](http://eliterature.org) and the international research project [ELMCIP](http://elmcip.net/knowledgebase) document it extensively. Much of this documentation has become media archeology since multimedia formats have become obsolete: CD-ROM applications that no longer run on contemporary computers, websites whose links or plug-ins are no longer working or not compatible to today's browsers anymore. 

This problem was greater in the 1990s and early 2000s when working open, cross-platform multimedia standards barely existed. But even today, the rule explained in chapter ... <!-- cross-reference to Arjen's overview graph of non-visual vs. visual epublishing technologies--> still applies: The more complex the audiovisuality of an electronic book, the less compatible it will be to all kinds of different electronic reading devices, and the more technical updates it will likely need over the course of time. 

##### Simple solutions

Electronic visual books can be made in very simple ways:
* As a sequence of images, embedded into an epub file <!-- add reference-->, a self-contained HTML file <!-- add reference--> or a PDF file.
* As a PDF file. PDF generally is the most easy-to-use straightforward format for visual publications in a universally working format.[^2] PDF documents can be graphically designed to work on different screen sizes, and resolution of embedded visuals can be decreased to keep the file size friendly for downloading. Still, the format is essentially limited to fixed document sizes and remains an electronic representation of printed matter. 
* Other standard file formats creatively (ab)used as document formats for visual books: animated GIF graphics files for the digital equivalent of flip books, for example, mp4 video files displaying a real-time book, mp3 audio files triggering abstract art on the volume meter display of an audio player, JPEG files with encoding artefacts of corrupted bits.[^3] 
* Self-contained HTML. <!--- explain the use of self-contained HTML with base64--->

As opposed to generic PDF, PDF/A requires that all fonts, references and color profiles are fully embedded into a document.

###5) New genres

By new types of publications we mean publications which cannot easily be placed in one of the genres mentioned above. These could be publications which fall outside of what we would normally consider a 'book'. Examples could be an app or a series of tweets etc. Setting a predisposed set of parameters for this genre would be difficult. Similar to adventure games, here we can imagine the use of an interactive approach where the reader is able to control the narrative.


## New forms of publication

The goal of the project is to define a common ground for directions, strategies, and tools that will enhance the transition from paper-only publications to a mixture of paper & electronic publication, given the above listed genres of publications.
As the mind set of the partners in the projects are very diverse and in most companies the discussion is only in an early stage, it does not make sense to produce a matrix of all questions and all answers. A better approach is to try and sketch the overall picture, based on commonalities and diversions. This attempt is presented below. 

Independently of the different genres listed above, we can stratify from simple conversions from paper publications to electronic ones to full-scale electronic publications which allow one possible representation of its content as a print-on-demand (POD) traditional paper book.

Looking from this angle of incidence a division into three levels can be made.

A. One-to-one; when a book is considered as a separate product where text-authors, illustrators, artist photographers, and designers work together to produce the book as a one-off team.

B. One-to-many; this publication is not a single object, but has various chameleonic appearances, dependent from the context and available presentation media (type & size of screen/paper). 

C. One-to-database; here the various independent components are separately defined as modules that can be used multiple times and re-used by everybody that has access to the database. 

Below we expand a little more on this and compare it with our four genres:


###A) One-to-one publications

On the lowest level, we have the unique book. Here we consider each book as a separate product where text-authors, illustrators/artists/photographers, and designers work together to produce the book as a one-off team. As there are many of such unique books, the production workflow is traditional. Pictures and/or full layout pages are not (yet) considered as reusable digital objects. In many cases no archives of the independent ingredients that together creates the end-product are available. N.B. there are many common characteristics between books in one genre. Hence, the question is how we can reveal/define these characteristics to enhance insight in the nature of these books. Artist's/experimental books are the obvious example of this kind of book.

The issue at hand is experimenting with an e-representation of the same book. In some cases files of the final pages/book are being conversed into Epub3 (by an external agent). The final pages are controlled on readability and clearness (e.g. figures and captions have to be on the same page), changed where needed and hey presto – the e-book is ready. On this level the e-book is not more than an exact-as-possible picture of the printed book. In such cases the publisher might use a document management system, which can be a mere system of folders. Archiving files is important for possible reprints. Workflows are to a large extent unique though follow traditional publication path ways.

###B) One-to-many publications

On the next level we see a bifurcation between the manifestation of a paper print version and the electronic version. In fact, the electronic version, contrary to the paper version, is not a single object but has various chameleonic appearances. This is due to the fact that the presentation substrate of an electronic book is not unique. Furthermore the sizes of reading devices are not standardised and allow for both portrait or oblong viewing. On top of this, the popular semi-standard Epub3 allows for flowable pages and allows the reader to change the font and fontsize (corps) to avoid the need of reading glasses for a more pleasant consumer experience. The best example of the one-to-many publication are the art/design catalogue-like publications and research-like publications. In this category workflow schemes become very important as the same (part of) texts and images are used in various outlets. A workflow and related descriptors (metadata) set is compulsory. Future readers must be able to make choice from the collection of available essays. The most stable approach might be a XML based database model

###C) One-to-database

The next level is Database Publishing. Database publishing means that all those objects or entities that can be used independently from each other. This means that it can be used in multiple ways, can be easily reused, are uniquely defined and stored in a memory system. As a precondition for full scale database publishing, the editorial workflow is important, because it is there that a decision is being made on what items are defined as individual entities and which characteristics and features (metadata) they have. In the case of a collection of essays, the page-layout is of less importance compared to full colour art books; the accidental picture or graph can be easily accommodated. A series of essays (and blogposts) mimics a journal publication with more-or-less fixed lay out. After all, a new volume in a yearly series is only special the year of publication. Later on the essays of that volume are just one item of the collection (though with metadata indicating the year of publication and related details). However, in all instances the workflow demands for this type of projects might serve as an example for others towards a full database approach. This means that the workflow scheme must have such a coherent structure that choices are explicated. It is never a one-workflow-fits-all, but the scheme of metadata can be complete as not all of the fields have to be used.
