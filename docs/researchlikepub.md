### General questions


#### Decision making

**Should it be a 1:1 transfer from paper book to e-book?**  
This is the traditional view.  
The book is a unique, one off publication.  
A lot of different people working on separate parts of the project, but all towards one single goal: the end product, mostly print, sometimes translated 1:1 to an e-book.

With text oriented files this may seem the most straightforward, maybe even the only useful way. There is not more than text, perhaps accompanied by a couple of images. Most important is e.g. to get references right, and a nice advantage is that making an index will be much easier digitally.

**What are alternative possibilities?**  
What is possible when using a hybrid workflow, focused as much on e-publications as on print? (Next to having digital publications running naturally from the workflow, instead of having to be forced out of the print oriented workflow, of course)  
* Version control can be more transparant   
* Adding elements other than text (videos, (color) images, links)  
* Extracting outputs from the material different from the book itself, such as abstract, booktrailers, personalized ePubs  
...

#### Instructions

**How to adjust the style guide?**  
The decision about the desired output leads to certain steps to get the right input. First of all it is therefore necessary to communicate this to the authors and others involved in the publishing process. Adjust your style guide which is leading in the communication with authors/designers/programmers etc.

Specify for example:  
* file format - for example, if you are following the proposed workflow, request the file to be sent in either html directly (which can be converted into ePub) or docx (which can be easily converted into html)  
* image style and format - while the print book has b/w pictures, the e-book enables colour images; print requires large quality 300 dpi .tiff images, while these may be too hevay for a digital publication, skyrocketing the size of the book, which is bad for download / and or storage space on an e-reader  
* formatting styles - use Header 1 style for title and author, Header 2 for article sections and Header 3 for subsections  
* URL style - full URLs should be clickable but not stylized as links (color or underlining)  
* which metadata the author has to provide - e.g. keywords, contact information, abstract, biography     
* an extended example of a style guide adjusted for a hybrid workflow can be found in the appendix <!-- Is this possible and desirable? ^Miriam -->

**What metadata to add?**  
Make a list of metadata to be added to the texts  
* metadata provided by the author(s)  
* metadata added by the editor/publisher
* an extended example of a metadata list adjusted for a hybrid workflow can be found in the appendix <!-- Is this possible and desirable? ^Miriam -->

**Do editorial criteria regarding the content change?**  
Editorial criteria for the content can also differ in a hybrid workflow and depending on the desired output and the answer to the question of the relationship between the print and electronic edition:  
* (not discussed in this guide) consider another style of writing, 'writing for the web'   
* is interactive material needed, more or other images than can be published in print, video, audio, etc.  

#### Specific issues for this publication type
Important issues in the hybrid workflow for research publications ar
1. the editorial process, with comments and copyediting
2. footnotes and referencing
