##Reader Software##
Standalone applications for desktops, tablets and smartphones offer some advantages to the software present on e-readers. Firstly almost all devices offer a full colour display, as opposed to the monochrome e-ink screens of e-readers. Secondly, a lot of applications support a larger subset of the EPUB standard, which allows for more features - like custom fonts, layout styling, etc.

###Mobile applications###
There exist many applications for mobile devices (tablets and smartphones). Some of the available software constitute of companion apps to well-known e-readers, like Amazon's Kindle and Kobo's range of reader hardware. The other category contains applications which are not available e-readers and often offer their own storefront, viz. iBooks and Aldiko. EPUB 2.0 and 3.0 support is generally available, but some of the applications require the user to convert files into a proprietary file format in order for the e-reader to be able to read the document. Kindle is an example, as it only supports Amazon's proprietary file formats (AZW, KF8) and PDF.

###PC Software###
A plethora of desktop applications exist which allow users to read EPUBs. Of the five applications mentioned above only Aldiko is not available on desktops and iBooks is a Mac-only application. Kobo and Kindle both offer Windows and Mac versions of their software. The functionality is similar to that of the mobile versions.

Calibre is an application of note here, because it's an e-book management suite with many features. It offers tools for managing large collections of e-books, but also converts files to many different formats (e-books and other text based formats)[^calibre-file-formats]. Viewing all major e-books file formats, as well as editing EPUBs and AZWs is also part of the software package.

###Web Platforms###
There exist some web platforms for reading EPUBs online, their popularity is hard to gauge. A project called Bookworm, developed by Threepress, was closed by O'Reilly Labs in 2012. The reason given for the closure mentions an "interesting experiment" but also the dramatic changes in the e-book ecosystem over the past few years. [Booki.sh](https://booki.sh), another project is still online and offers a complete library of e-books which may be view and stored online. It doesn't appear to operate commercially though, the ability to purchase books was removed in June 2013.[^bookish-blog]

###Browser Applications###
Apart from web applications, several browser extensions exist allowing users to read EPUBs in their web browser. These extensions are probably more of a convenience method in order to quickly (pre)view e-books, instead of being fully-fledged solutions for reading e-books comparable to the functionality of e-readers.

One example is Readium, a project by the idpf and several publishers and technology companies. It aims to provide a reference system, a collection of best practices, for rendering EPUB 3 publications. [^readium-goals] The Readium Project offers a range of tools for online and offline use, mainly geared towards software developers. One of the tools is a browser extension [^readium-extension] for the Google Browser. After installing the extension offers an EPUB reader inside the browser window.

###Mobile applications###
####iBooks####
iBooks is Apple's e-reader application for iPhone, iPad and Mac. Books may be bought in the iTunes Store or can be copied from a desktop to the library of iBooks. The latest version of iBooks offers support for many of the features of the EPUB 3 standard, but also PDF and	 the closed-source `.ibooks` file format (IBA) - a derivative of EPUB 3.

####Marvin####
Marvin is another application and one of the few paid entries. It doesn't offer its own store and is mainly geared towards managing existing collections compiled from various sources. Marvin only accepts EPUBS and offers to convert incompatible file formats using third party software package Calibre.

####Aldiko####
Aldiko is both a storefront and an e-reader for Android which supports EPUB and PDF. As such it is comparable to Apple's iBooks. There exists a paid version which offers some extra features (annotation, removal of advertisements) as opposed to the free offering.

####Kindle####
Kindle is Amazon's counterpart for tablets and smartphones to their physical e-readers (Kindle Paperwhite, etc.). The application is available for both iOS and Android. Books can be bought from inside the application on Android, on iOS it's less straightforward due to the restrictions Apple places on in-app purchasing. Kindle for mobile devices only has support for Amazon's proprietary file formats (AZW, KF8) and PDF. EPUBs have to be converted using software like Calibre, in order for Kindle to be able to import them into its library. The application is able to sync its library so that a collection of e-books is available on both the Kindle e-reader and in the application.

####Kobo####
Kobo, like Amazon, produces e-reader hardware and also has a large bookstore. As such the apps they offer for Android and iOS are largely complementary to the e-reader companion devices manufactured by Kobo. Libraries are synced across devices, provided all the content is bought in Kobo's bookstore. Kobo supports both EPUB and PDF files.


###PC Software###
####Calibre####
Calibre is an e-book management suite with many features. It offers tools for managing large collections of e-books, but also converts files to many different formats (e-books and other text based formats)[^calibre-file-formats]. Viewing all major e-books file formats, as well as editing EPUBs and AZWs is also part of the software package.

####Adobe Digital Editions####
Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) is an e-book reader and management tool which is able to read EPUB and PDF. Support for EPUB 3 is incomplete though, though Adobe claims support for all the important features is present - without elaborating what those important features are. ADE also integrates with many e-readers offering syncing possibilities. So a library managed with ADE could in theory be synced with a compatible e-reader.[^ade-readers]

Apart from web applications, several browser extensions exist allowing users to read EPUBs in their web browser. These extensions are probably more of a convenience method in order to quickly (pre)view e-books, instead of being fully-fledged solutions for reading e-books comparable to the functionality of e-readers.

####Readium####
Readium is a project by several publishers and technology companies aiming to provide a reference system, a collection of best practices, for rendering EPUB 3 publications.

One of the tools is a browser extension [^readium-extension] for the Google Browser. After installing the extension offers an EPUB reader inside the browser window.

####EPUBReader####
EPUBReader is similar to the browser extension offered by Readium, the main difference is the supported browser, as EPUBReader is only compatible with Mozilla Firefox.
