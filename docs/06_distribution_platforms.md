Social reading has to do with the experience of reading electronic books (ebooks). It is a field in great development, which lies beyond the scope of this Toolkit. However, it is good for publishers working on e-publications to keep an eye on the future of social reading.

Examples of social reading platforms are: 
 
- *Goodreads* ('Goodreads is the world’s largest site for readers and book recommendations. Our mission is to help people find and share books they love. Goodreads launched in January 2007.')  
- *Social Book* ('Social Book, created by the Institute for the Future of the Book, is a social reading platform that allows reader to add their own commentary to texts, share these ideas with others, follow others’ comments, and create communities of interactive reader/writers.')    
- *Wattpad* ('Wattpad stories are free. Whether you’re online or off, use the devices you already own to carry an entire library wherever you go.' 'Join the conversation about the stories you read: message the writer and interact with other people who love the story as much as you.')
- *Hebban* (A Dutch social reading platform that released in beta version in 2014)  
- *Social media discussions* are also part of the social reading experience
