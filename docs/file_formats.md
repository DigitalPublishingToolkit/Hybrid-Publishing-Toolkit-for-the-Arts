##File formats##
The history of the modern e-book can be traced back to the late 1990s with the establishment of the *Open eBook Forum* tasked with the creation of the *Open eBook Publication Structure* (OEBPS). Microsoft was heavily involved in the development of what became the *Open eBook* based partly on technology created by a company called SoftBook Press. [^businessweek-ebooks] SoftBook Press developed the format, based on XML and XHTML, as a companion to their e-reader. The *Open eBook* specification had its first release in 1999 and was later renamed to EPUB when the standard reached the 2.0 version milestone under the auspices of the *International Digital Publishing Forum* (IDPF, formerly the *Open eBook Forum*). [^interoperability-of-ebook-formats] The EPUB 2.0 standard has support for basic styling, custom fonts, etc. [^epub2-specification]

At the beginning of Amazon's foray into the world of digital publishing, the online bookseller chose not to use EPUB but opted to buy a French company responsible for the development of *Mobipocket SA* and the MOBI file format. One of the main reasons for this move was the widely supported Digital Rights Management (DRM) engineered by *Mobipocket*. [^amazon-aquires-mobipocket] Technically, the MOBI file-format is partly based on *PalmDOC*, an ebook file-format readable on PDAs running the OS developed by Palm Inc., with added support for the guidelines taken from the *Open eBook* standard. [^mobileread-palmdoc] Mobilepocket and Amazon then developed the format further in order for it to be used exclusively with *Mobipocket* and, later, Amazon *Kindle* e-readers. The MOBI format is now called AZW by Amazon, their generic term for all e-books released by the company. [^amazon-azw]

Nowadays, roughly two generations of widely used e-book formats exist. One generation is based on the EPUB 2.0 standard as introduced in 2007, or an earlier version released under the *Open eBook* moniker. Amazon's MOBI/AZW is an example of this, as it's still widely used and supported by the *Kindle* e-readers. The other generally implements features from the EPUB 3.0 standard, while often remaining backwards compatible with older versions and subsets of EPUB 2.0 and even 1.0 to a certain extent. EPUB 3.0, released in 2011 [^epub3-specification], brought support for HTML 5 (as opposed to XHTML 1.1 in EPUB 2.0), more advanced styling using CSS3, scripting (discouraged in EPUB 2.0) and easy embedding of video and audio, amongst others. [^epub3-changes]
EPUB 3.0 forms the basis of most of the e-book file formats available today. Most of the current file formats, like Amazon's AZW3/KF8 and Apple's iBooks, implement most of the EPUB standard, mainly to benefit from the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications, while adding their own proprietary extensions. [^amazon-kf8][^ibooks-author] These extensions are mainly geared towards extra support for more advanced (fixed) layout options, rich media integration and DRM. [^ibooks-photo-blocks][^ibooks-multicolumn][^amazon-kf8] An AZW3/KF8 e-book is basically an EPUB 3.0 wrapped in Amazon's DRM. For backwards compatibility a MOBI version of the publication is generally also present in the e-book package. [^azw3kf8-breakdown]

Of course EPUB 3.0 files without proprietary extensions exist as well and are sold to various commercial channels. In addition to their own iBooks file format, Apple also sells EPUBs in their online store. [^epub-seller-apple] Other major players include Kobo, Google Play and Barnes & Nobles' NookPress.
