# 03 Genres of Publication

In the present project we deal with various kinds of products which we combine into  five genres: 

 1) Research publication;  

 2) Art/design catalogue;  

 3) Artist/designer book;  

 4) Art/design periodical;  

 5) New genres of publication.


##1) Research publication 

- Heavy in use of text
- Texts take a central role
- Visuals are secondary (images refer to texts)
- Often longer texts
- Often with a standardised structure

**Issues and advantages of going electronic:**  

<!-- Silvio: I'd begin with the advantages in the mundane activity of quoting a text, made immediate thanks to copy paste.

Another obvious but crucial advantage is search within the text.

Another possible advantage is to embed the datasets employed in the publication itself.

Referencing is still an issue as there is no standard way to specifiy che location of the reference (no fixed page number anymore)

A mention of open access might be worthwhile.

Finally, commenting and annotating and sharing these annotations is a problem as  they don't stick with the book as it happens with physical books. -->


One of the issues with going electronic with a research-like publication is setting parameters for the use of and interaction between text and images. Advantages of going electronic with this type of publication have to do with the wider reach and availability of the content. Making the text available digitally could increase its spreading. This is often a goal of research-like publications. Another advantage is that, due to the high level of standardised structure, a 'modularisation' of the content becomes possible thereby allowing to go beyond the traditional way of essay writing. In particular when authors refer to each other, they often share data, quotations, tables, figures, etc. Multiple use and reuse of 'modules' will enormously enhance the communication within a community.[^Kircz]

##2) Art/design catalogue

- Heavy in use of images
- Visuals take central role over texts
- Visuals are primary (text refers to visuals)
- Descriptive texts of changing lengths

**Issues and advantages of going electronic:**  

One of the main issues which arise when trying to go electronic with Art/design catalogue-like publications lies in the use of images. The quality of the images is important. They must often be high in quality with as little distortion of colours as possible. An issue of concern is that often a fixed page layout determines the message. Changes in size might influence the flow of content. An advantage of going electronic with this type of publication could lie in the use of other (interactive) materials and easier distribution.  


##3)  Artist/designer book

- Book *by* an artist, rather than *about* an artist
- Complex use of images and typography, often pushing the possibilities of the medium
- In print: making use of the book as a material, visual and haptic object;
- Difficult or impossible translation into other media;
- Text is often used in non-descriptive or non-narrative ways.

**Issues and advantages of going electronic:** 
An issue with making a digital publication out of an artist's/experimental book is the choice of material. The choice to go digital in this case is the most fundamental. Furthermore, here too, the quality of images and the relation between text and images is important. The choices which are being made by the creator influence the final outcome immensely. Advantages of going digital lie in the more extensive possibilities digitalization offers (e.g. interactive material etc.).
<!-- For this kind of publication, the 'advantages-issues' model doesn’t really work. As artists' books represent a reflection around the medium itself, there is no advantage or disadvantage in choosing a digital format, it's just a different choice. That said, choosing a electronic format like epub for an artist's book means to master the specificities of such formats. I think this is one of the reason why there is a few digital artists' books. -->


##4) Art/design periodical

- Heavy in use of both texts and images 
- Both images and texts take central role
- Use of images is both primary and secondary
- Texts of changing lengths
- A more-or-less fixed page-layout format
- Recurring publication format (e.g. magazines, series etc.)


**Issues and advantages of going electronic:**  

One of the issues with going digital with an art/design periodical lies in the limitations of the digital medium. The periodical thrives well by its physical presence. It can be tossed in a bag and just as easily be disposed of. In a digital form, the physical presence becomes limited. Another issue with going digital with an art/design periodical lies in the archival aspect. New articles can refer to older ones and even integrate parts. The periodical as such becomes a repository and therefore a playground for new work. An advantage of going electronic with this kind of periodical lies in the increased possibilities in extending content (interactivity, video etc.). 
<!-- One of the advantages in 3 out of 5 publication formats is that the content can be extended. It is worthwhile to state the fact that a heavy publication (with videos, etc.) is a problem from the point of view of 1. Developing countries, 2. Archive -->


Another specific advantage of the periodical lies in the decreasing of distribution costs and the convenience with which a large audience can be reached. 


##5) New genres of publication

By new types of publications we mean publications which cannot easily be placed in one of the genres mentioned above. These could be publications which fall outside of what we would normally consider a 'book'. Examples could be an app or a series of tweets etc. Setting a predisposed set of parameters for this genre would be difficult. Similar to adventure games, here we can imagine the use of an interactive approach where the reader is able to control the narrative or to build or customize the publication. For example one can think of platforms used to collect tweets in book form or **tumblogs** in an epub as shown during the Off the Press conference.


## Three levels of electronic publishing

The goal of the project is to define a common ground for directions, strategies, and tools that will enhance the transition from paper-only publications to a mixture of paper & electronic publication, given the above listed genres of publications.
As the mindset of the partners in the projects are very diverse and in most companies the discussion is only in an early stage, it does not make sense to produce a matrix of all questions and all answers. A better approach is to try and sketch the overall picture, based on commonalities and diversions. This attempt is presented below. 

Independently of the different genres listed above, we can stratify from simple conversions from paper publications to electronic ones to full-scale electronic publications which allow one possible representation of its content as a print-on-demand (POD) traditional paper book.

A division into three levels can be made:

1. One-to-one; when a book is considered as a separate product where text-authors, illustrators, artist photographers, and designers work together to produce the book as a one-off team.

2. One-to-many; this publication is not a single object, but has various chameleonic appearances, dependent from the context and available presentation media (type & size of screen/paper). 

3. One-to-database; here the various independent components are defined as modules that can be used and re-used multiple times by whomever has acces to them.

Below we expand a little more on this and compare it with the mentioned genres:

<!-- Kimmy and loes: perhas the three levels can also be visualised?-->
![Three Levels of Electronic Publishing](../images/_in_progress/04_1_three_levels "Three Levels of Electronic Publishing")


###1) One-to-one publications

On the first level, we have the unique book. Here we consider each book as a separate product where authors, illustrators/artists/photographers, and designers work together to produce the book as a one-off team. As there are many of such unique books, the production workflow is traditional. Pictures and/or full layout pages are not yet considered as reusable digital objects. In many cases no archives of the independent ingredients that together create the end-product are available. Take note that there are many common characteristics between books in one genre. Hence, the question is how we can reveal and define these characteristics to enhance insight in the nature of this type of book. Artist’s/experimental books are an obvious example of this kind of book.

In light of this, the issue at hand is experimenting with an e-representation of the same book. In some cases files of the final pages/book are being converted into epub3 by an external agent. The final pages are checked on readability and clearness (for example, that figures and captions are on the same page) and changes are made accordingly to create the e-book. On this level the e-book is not more than an exact-as-possible picture of the printed book. In such cases the publisher might use a document management system, which can be a mere system of folders/directories. Archiving files is important for possible reprints. Often publishing houses are forced to scan their own book in order to reprint them because they don't have an archived version of it. Moreover having an archive of the semantically structured contents allows reissuing the publication in ways that were not envisioned before. Workflows are to a large extent unique though follow traditional publication path ways. 


###2) One-to-many publications

On the next level we see a split between the manifestation of a paper print version and the electronic version. In fact, the electronic version, contrary to the paper version, is not a single object but has various appearances. This is due to the fact that the presentation substrate of an electronic book is not unique. Furthermore, the sizes of reading devices are not standardised and generally allow for both portrait or oblong viewing. On top of this, the popular semi-standard epub3 allows for flowable pages and allows the reader to change the font and fontsize (corps) to avoid the need of reading glasses for a more pleasant consumer experience. The best example of the one-to-many publication are the art/design catalogue-like publications and research-like publications. In this category workflow schemes become very important as the same texts and images are used in various outlets. A workflow and related descriptors (metadata) set is compulsory. Future readers must be able to make choice from the collection of available essays. The most stable approach, but also one the most complex ones, might be a XML based database.

###3) One-to-database

The next level is Database Publishing. Database publishing means that all objects or entities can be used independently from each other. This means that they can be used in multiple ways, can be easily reused, are uniquely defined and stored in a database. As a precondition for full scale database publishing, the editorial workflow is important, because it is there that a decision is being made on what items are defined as individual entities and which characteristics and features (metadata) they have. In the case of a collection of essays, the page-layout is of less importance compared to full colour art books; the accidental picture or graph can be easily accommodated. A series of essays (and blogposts) mimics a journal publication with more-or-less fixed lay out. After all, a new volume in a yearly series is only special the year of publication. Later on the essays of that volume are just one item of the collection (though with metadata indicating the year of publication and related details). However, in all instances the workflow demands for this type of projects might serve as an example for others towards a full database approach. This means that the workflow scheme must have such a coherent structure that choices are explicated. It is important to note that there will never be a one workflow which fits all but if the relevant metadata is available; publications in different forms can be created.
