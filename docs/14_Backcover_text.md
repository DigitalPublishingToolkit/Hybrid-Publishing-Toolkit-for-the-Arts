We read and publish increasingly more on electronic devices. What used to be a trend in sciences, news media and mainstream book publishing has now also reached contemporary arts and design - where paper books are turning into collectible design objects while everyone reads media like e-flux or downloads from UbuWeb. Often, the traditional model of art book publishing is no longer viable. Many are looking into electronic publishing as an alternative but are unfamiliar with its practicalities. 

This toolkit gives authors, editors, artists, designers and publishers working in art and design publishing all they need to know about hybrid print and electronic publishing, with an emphasis on books. Based on real-world scenarios including catalogues, research publications and artists' books, it gives pragmatic advice and step-by-step instructions based on working, accessible technologies and practices - with a focus on what is doable and sensible now, on opportunities as well as current limitations.
