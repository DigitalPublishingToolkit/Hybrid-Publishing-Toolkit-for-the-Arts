Toolkit: General introduction v1
Novel electronic capabilities enable a great number of possible publication outlets. Before entering into the problematic aspects of such a plurality of presentations of the same massage such as the fact that variations in lay-out can make communal (social) reader and discussing a text more difficult, we investigate the possibilities.
As with all technological possibilities the coin has two sides (leaving aside the unstable rim) that exclude each other.  The printing press introduced pagination and indexing allowing many thousands of identical texts to be read and compared by even more readers over the years. In an electronic world with non-fixed screen sizes, this fact becomes problematic. On paper text is fixed and this allows comparisons and interactions between different readers, separated in space and in time possible.  In an electronic version the fixity of the text remains, as the text file is independent from its final substrate (e-ink, lcd, paper), but its presentation onto the final substrate can vary substantially.  The challenge even becomes more interesting if we widen our ambition to pictures, audio&video, hyper links, etc. which all represent a different type of human communication than simple flat text. 
In the Toolkit project we attack the field of art books. This category of books integrates all aspects of text-only publications but expands it to visual information that can be explanatory of the text and -even more- importantly to visual information which is a "stand alone" statement such as abstract oil painting. In such cases text, explanatory audio files, recited poetry inspired by the painting and look-alike examples of other art works help the "reader" (viewer) to deeper appreciate and understand the object. 
It is clear that various forms of art books demand and enable different electronic representations. 
Nevertheless, as over the centuries cultural standardisation came to the fore in the sense that a detective, a religious book or an educational book can still be distinguished in a split second by its typography and lay-out, this will also become a fact for electronic books.   
Apart from the electronic (or paper) book as a "object d'art", electronic art book publishing will have many commonalities despite its different genre. A major issue is that the electronic sub structure into which the digital files containing the various kinds of information are all equal on the level of digital bit streams in the computer memory: just standardised code.
The great new thing in the world of electronic art books is that, based on standardised, though well tailored, structures  the creative message can be published in a great variety of ways, depending on not only the capabilities of the output (reading/viewing/listening) device but also on the role the book plays for the author, in a present context, such as a look-up, a study, a reference, a coffee table, or a leisure book. The same source can and will be represented differently under different circumstances. 
All this vistas demand a thorough editorial and production strategy. Not only because the same source can express itself in various output forms but even more because once proper edited and stored electronic, information and its constituting parts can be reused and multiple used by others than the original creator(s).  
In the present project we deal with various kinds of products which we lump together in five genres:  1) Art/Design Catalogue like, 2) Research-like publication, 3) Art/design periodical, 4)  Artist's/experimental books, 5) New types of publications.
1) Art/Design Catalogue like
By Art/Design catalogue-like publication we mean the type of publication which is often considered the traditional art book. This type of publication is usually visually orientated with the text being a reference to the images. 
Text is often descriptive. Images take a central role. 
- Heavy in use of images
- images take central role over texts
- images are primary (text refers to images)
- Descriptive texts of changing lenghts
Issues and advantages of going electronic:
One the main issues which arise when trying to go electronic with Art/Design catalogue  publication lies in the use of images. The quality of the images is important; are the colours realistic? is there enough detail visible? Because the images take on a central role, their quality needs to be very high.   
An advantage of going electronic with this type of publication could lie in the use of other (interactive) material. 
An issue of concern is that often a fixed page lay out determines the message. Changes in size might influence the flow of content.
2) Research-like publication 
By Research-like publications we mean publications which are text orientated and which often use images in an illustrative manner. Here the text is of a clear rhetoric character. The auteur(s) want to convey a report of work done and a reasoning about it. 
- heavy in use of text
- texts take a central role
- images are secondary (images refer to texts)
- often longer texts
- particularly in scientific and educational texts, we encounter a high level of standardised structuring.
Issues and advantages of going electronic:
Advantages of going electronic with this type of publication have to do with the wider reach and availability of text. Making the text available digitally could increase its spreading. This is often a goal of research-like publications. 
Due to the high level of standard  structure a "modularisation" of the content becomes possible allowing to go beyond the traditional essay type of writing. As already proven in the big repositories of the international science publishers, this allows for standardised metadata schemes, compatible with the XML standard.
One of the issues with going electronic with a research-like publication is setting parameters for the use of and interaction between text and images, as well as the standardisation of the image file type.  If people want to reuse an image or want to integrate parts into a new image, SVG might become a standard. Though such a step is presently beyond current practice.
3) Art/design periodical
By Art and design periodical we mean publications which are recurring in nature. These could be series of publications or magazine-like publications
- Heavy in use of texts and images and mixtures of both
- Both images and texts take central role
- Use of images is both primary and secondary
- Texts of changing lengths
- a more-or-less fixed page-layout format
Issues and advantages of going digital:
One of the issues with going digital with a Art/Design periodical lies in the archival aspect. New articles can refer to older once and even integrate parts. The periodical as such become a repository and therewith a playground for new work.
4)  Artist's/experimental books
By Artist's/experimental book we mean publications created by artists as art works in their own right (rather than being books _about_ artists or art projects). These books do not have a specific set of rules. They could be objects by themselves and take on different forms.
Some characteristics:
- artistic inquiry into what a book is;
- complex use of images and typography, often pushing the possibilities of the medium;
- in print: making use of the book as a material, visual and haptic object;
- difficult or impossible translation into other media;
- text is often used in non-descriptive or non-narrative ways.
5) New types of publications
By new types of publications we mean publications which cannot easily be placed in one of the genres mentioned above. These could be publications which fall outside of what we would normally consider a 'book'. Examples could be an app or a series of tweets etc. Setting a predisposed set of parameters for this genre would be difficult. Also publications with game aspects belong to this category. 
The goal of the project was (and still is) how to define a common ground for directions, strategies, and tools that will enhance the transition from paper-only publications to a mixture of paper & electronic products, given the above listed kinds of publications.
As the mind set of the partners in the projects are very diverse and in most companies the discussion is only in an early stage, it does not make sense (and too time consuming) to produce a matrix of all questions and all answers. A better approach is to try and sketch the overall picture, based on commonalities and diversions. This attempt is presented below. 
Independently of the different genres as listed above and dealt with in the following of this publication, we can also stratify from more or less simple conversions from paper products to electronic ones to full scale electronic publications that allow one possible representation of its content as a print-on-demand (POD) traditional paper book.
Looking from this angle of incidence a division into three levels can be made.
A. One-to-One; where a book is considered as a separate product where text-authors, illustrators, artist photographers, and designers work more or less in a one-time team to produce the book. 
B. One-to-Many; this book is not a single object, but has various cameliontic appearances, dependent from the context and available presentation media (type & size4 of screen/paper). 
C. One-to-Database; here the various more-or-less independent components are separately defined as modules that can be multiple used and re-used by everybody that has access to the database. It goes without saying that such modules must be well defined and cushioned in a equally well defined system of metadata.
Below we expand a bit on this and compare it with our four ganres.
A) One to One Publications
On the lowest level (low in the sense of a possible full scale database publishing approach), we have the Unique book. Here we consider each book as a separate product where text-authors, illustrators/artists/photographers, and designers work more or less in a one-time team to produce the book.           
As there are many of such one-time books, the production pipe-line is traditional. Pictures and/or full layout pages are not (yet) considered as (partly of full) reusable digital objects. In many cases no archive of the -in principle- independent ingredient that together creates the end-product is available. Like with people, every book is an individual.
Though!, like people in the background there are many common treats. Hence, the question is how we can reveal/define these treats to enhance insight in the character of these books (which after all can immediately, after a quick visual inspection, be categorised as one tribe in the kingdom of books). 
Artist's/experimental books are the bets example of this kind.
As we are dealing with unique objects, the idea of a standardized mark-up approach where content and presentation are disjoined, though with a clear idea about the lay-out style of the various end-products is not yet developed. 
The only issue on the table is experimenting with an e-representation of the same book. In this case files of the final pages/book are being conversed into Epub3 (by an external agent). The final pages are controlled on readability and clearness (e.g. figures and captions have to be on the same page), changed where needed and presto, the e-book is ready. 
On this level the e-book is not more than an exact-as-possible picture of the printed book. 
In such cases the publisher might have a document management system, which can be not more that a systematic system of nested folders.
Archiving files is important for possible reprints.
Work flows are to a large extent unique thought follow traditional publication path ways.
One to Many Publications
2) On the next level we see a bifurcation between the paper print version of a book and the electronic version. In fact the electronic version, contrary to the paper version, is not a single object but has various cameliontic appearances.
This due to the fact that the presentation substrate of an electronic book is not unique. It can be a CRT (cathode ray tube), a  LCD (liquid crystal display) or a plasma screen. It can also be a stable "still" e-ink screen. Furthermore the sizes of these devices are not standardised at all and any allow for portrait or oblong viewing. On top of this, the popular semi-standard Epub3 allows for flowable pages and allows the reader to change the corps to avoid the need of reading glasses for a more pleasant consumer behaviour.
This type is typical for Art/Design Catalogue like publications and Research-like publication
Here we see the emergence of  is a mixture of paper books/ periodicals and web pages. An example is the Institute of Network Cultures (INC) project which tries to create a web-based collection of chapters from book(series) on such a way that a reader can collect various chapters into one personalised collection.
In this category workflow schemes become very important as the same (part of) texts and images are used in various outlets.
Even stronger: a workflow and related descriptors (metadata) set is compulsory. Future readers must be able to make choice out of the collection of available essays and (blogposts).
Though, obviously the best and most stable approach would be a XML based database model (which does not mean that all fields of such a model are actually filled at the start of the project), the choice is now for a limited version, whose contours are still under discussion. See also the following.
C ) Database Publications
The next level is  Data Base Publishing.
Data base publishing means that all those objects or entities that can be used independently from others and hence can be used in multiple ways as well as easily reused are uniquely defined and stored in a memory system.
As a precondition for full scale database publishing, the editorial workflow is always important, because it is there that a decision is made what items are defined as individually entities and what characteristics and describers (metadata) they have.  
In the case of a collection of essays, the page-layout is of less importance compared to full colour art books; the accidental picture or graph can be easily accommodated. A series of essays (and blogsposts) mimics a journal publication with more-or-less fixed lay out. After all, a new volume in a yearly series is only special the year of publication. Later on the essays of that volume are just one item of the collection (though with metadata indicating the year of publication and related details).
However, in all instances the Workflow demands for this type of projects might serve as an example for others towards a full database-approach. This means that the workflow schema must have such a coherent structure that choices are explicated. E.g. if one accepts that the author's name is one single field without an indication what the family name is, no automatic index can be made, nor for the volume, nor for the entire selection. 
Never one workflow fits all, but the schema of metadata can be complete as not all fields have to be used.
A second important aspect of the INC project, which it has in common with the Valiz project (both to be diuscussed in detail in the next chapters) is the -general need- to create a well-defined pipeline from incoming compuscript (most of the time MS .doc or .docx files) into; on the one
A consequence of the above understanding is that we have to start thinking in modules: text modules as well as picture modules. 
The Stedelijk Museum project will become a prime example of such an approach. Here visitors of the museum get small pictures of highlights of the collection on their phone and are offered a menu of choises.
In this as case the primary viewer (the Phone) is like a "kijk-shop" (view box), a catalogue of items whose descriptions and thumbnails are cheap or free, allowing the user to collect his/her own set of "elements" in a desired form. E.g. a large file with all pictures fit for large screen viewing, or a Print On Demand (POD) book on good paper with a variable text, such as "Complied by X for this Grand Mother Y's 95th Birthday". 
Obviously we are now immediately entering a database model in which each object (including open free text cells) is well defined. This means every object (text, picture, sound or video) has a name, a number, a known length, a maximal size (which is the source for down conversion to the various demands of the substrates), keywords, dates, etc.  On top of this we have to realise that the viewing/reading of an online high-quality production demands a huge bandwidth, while a POD has  -in principle- no file size restrictions. 
The importance of such a model is that the exemplar of the SM, can be easily reconfigured to any pictural collection.
