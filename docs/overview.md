## How to use this toolkit
This toolkit will help you to develop e-pubs, specifically for arts publications. Chapter 3 will give a general introduction of this publications and sketches out various scenarios to develop e-pubs. Issues and opportunities of going electronic will be discussed, as well as strenghts and limitations of particular, reader hardware and software, file formats and lastly distribution platforms. 

Chapters 4 offers practical, how-to guidance for workflows (structured and per scenario) and designing e-pubs for the scenarios sketched out in chapter 3. Chapter 5 illustrates the  concepts with concrete examples from the Digital Publishing Toolkit program. You can learn something from all of them.....



In these pages, we will primarily concern ourselves with the software aspect of physical computing—designing code to work with physical objects that exhibit behavior or interactivity through software. Starting with the basic context of the Arduino platform to getting up and running with our first code, we will discuss the structure and syntax of Arduino’s C-based programming language, looking at variables, control structures, arrays, and memory. This book will then go into many of the functions unique to Arduino development for controlling digital and analog input and output, timing, randomness, writing functions, and using many of the Arduino libraries for working with different kinds of hardware and communication protocols.



## Why this toolkit


## For whom is this toolkit written
You may be a publisher, an experienced programmer or a designer or someone just starting out. You probably identify with or work in the arts fields. You may be hoping for some answers, gain knowledge, get tips, and conduct various resources. This toolkit intended to provide them all.
