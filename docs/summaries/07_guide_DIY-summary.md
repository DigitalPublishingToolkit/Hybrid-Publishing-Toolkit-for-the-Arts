- An EPUB file is basically a web site in a zip archive, plus some metadata files.
- EPUBs can be created from scratch, with any text program, just by creating HTML files, the required meta data files and by putting all files into the required folders.
- EPUBs can also be exported from InDesign projects if work within the program is done in a highly structured way, using the very latest version of the software.
- The Open Source command line program Pandoc is a very capable tool for translating text files into EPUB. However, the more structured the markup of the input text file, the better the translation.
- The graphical Open Source program Calibre can alternatively be used for document conversion and editing.
