- Hybrid publishing works best with a single source document that gets translated into different output formats (such as InDesign document, EPUB, Web site...).
- The traditional Word + InDesign workflow does not work well for ebook publishing.
- Markdown, a plain text format with simple markup, has many pragmatic advantages as the source format for a hybrid publication.
- It is very easy to learn and makes it easy to see whether a source document has been cleanly formatted.
- There are many text editing and document conversion programs that support Markdown.
- XML is technically even better, but often too complex for small publishers.
- Hybrid publication projects can also be authored in database-driven content management systems which have their own advantages and limitations.
