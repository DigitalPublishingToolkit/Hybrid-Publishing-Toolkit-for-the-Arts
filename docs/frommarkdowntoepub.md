Direct conversion to epub
=========================

![Simplest possible case](../images/gd_markdowntoepub_simple.svg)

Making an epub doesn't have to be complicated. As the epub standard is open and based on HTML (the same format as web pages), there's a large and growing variety of ways to convert and export to an epub from different kinds of sources. For very simple publications, it may be possible to use a tool that directly converts your document to an epub.

Two popular conversion programs that can convert from a wide variety of input formats and produce epub's are ''pandoc''[] and ''ebook-convert''[^1](http://manual.calibre-ebook.com/cli/ebook-convert.html). 

For example, consider Charlotte Bronte's ''Jane Eyre,'' available from Project Gutenberg in a variety of formats (including epub). The ["plain text" version](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1260/pg1260.txt), is the complete text of the book in a single file with no styling (no fonts, sizes, or bold etc).

TODO: Give simple example of using markdown + pandoc? to produce a simple epub.
