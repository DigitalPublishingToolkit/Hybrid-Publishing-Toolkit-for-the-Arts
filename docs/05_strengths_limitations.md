# Strengths & limitations of e-reading technologies

![Digital Publishing Range](../images/_in_progress/05_1_rich_poor "Digital Publishing Range") <!--Visual by Arjen-->

##Reader hardware
There are several ways to peruse electronic publications. Portable devices like e-readers or tablets are by far the most popular gateway to digital content. Smartphones also offer some of the capabilities of an e-reader, as most of these devices are a miniature version of their tablet counterparts. Lastly not to forget the desktop computer, often used in combination with the physical book, especially in the case of research publications.


###Ereaders
Ereaders became widely known with the introduction of the Amazon Kindle in 2007. Ereaders differ from tablets in the way that they are only suitable for reading books, are relatively cheap and have monochrome displays. An important characteristic of the e-reader is the use of *electronic paper* (e-paper), a so-called electrophoretic screen. Electronic paper is designed to mimic the characteristics of paper as closely as possible and is relatively low in energy consumption. The current generation of e-paper is incapable of rendering complex motion, so animations and videos are impossible to use.

Both Amazon and Barnes & Noble also offer more expensive models, Kindle Fire (and Kindle Fire HD) and NOOK Tablet (and NOOK HD+) respectively. These models are not really e-readers anymore, but fully-fledged, small sized tablets. These models do not use *e-paper*, but instead work with colour LED screens with backlight â€“ a standard component of tablets such as iPad and Galaxy Tab. Often these tablets use a version of the Android operating system as its core, in contrast to the classic monochromatic e-readers using their own operating system built on a version of Linux. The Samsung Galaxy Note and Apple iPad mini can be seen as an answer to the smaller sized tablets.

Because of the lack of a colour screen the current generation of e-readers is best suited for text-based publications, i.e. novels, etc.

###Tablets
The tablet-market is dominated by two main players,[^sales-figures-tablet] Apple and Samsung. Apple utilises their own operating system (iOS) for the iPad, while Samsung with its Galaxy Tab product line has opted for Android. The Android-segment of the market consists of many manufacturers offering similar hardware with a variant of Android as its operating system. Several e-reader applications exist for both iOS and Android, the most important ones will be reviewed in [the Reader Software]() section.

The most important advantage of tablets over traditional e-readers is the fact that the latter do not support colour. The upside of the tablet's colour screen is at the same time also its weakness, as backlit LED screens are generally known to cause eye fatigue. Furthermore, reading in the sun is problematic as well, because direct sunlight obscures most of the visibility of the screen. Battery life is another issue with tablets. Though newer tablet models often claim impressive battery life, e-readers still reign supreme with an average battery life of up to several weeks.

###Smartphone
The story for tablets also largely applies to the realm of smartphones.[^sales-figures-phone] Of course most smartphones have smaller screens than both e-readers and tablets. But the similarities between smartphones and tablets are large enough to justify clustering them with tablet devices. 

###PC/Laptop
Reading e-books on a laptop or personal computer is a possibility but may be a less natural fit than handheld devices. A full range of software for e-reading is available, but the same downsides of relatively limited battery life and increased chances of eye fatigue exist as with tablets.

##Reader software
Standalone applications for desktops, tablets and smartphones offer some advantages to the software present on e-readers. Firstly almost all devices offer a full colour display, as opposed to the monochrome e-ink screens of e-readers. Secondly, a lot of applications support a larger subset of the epub standard, which allows for more features - like custom fonts, layout styling, etc.

###Mobile applications
There are many existing applications for mobile devices (tablets and smartphones). Some of the available software constitutes of companion apps to well-known e-readers, like Amazon's Kindle and Kobo's range of reader hardware. The other category contains applications which are not for available e-readers but often offer their own storefront, viz. iBooks and Aldiko. epub 2.0 and 3.0 support is generally available, but some of the applications require the user to convert files into a proprietary file format in order for the e-reader to be able to read the document. Kindle is an example, as it only supports Amazon's proprietary file formats (AZW, KF8, mobi and txt) <!-- add to glossary --> and PDF (Portable Document Format).

####iBooks####
iBooks is Apple's e-reader application for iPhone, iPad and Mac. Books may be bought in the iTunes Store or can be copied from a desktop to the library of iBooks. The latest version of iBooks offers support for many of the features of the epub 3 standard, but also PDF and the closed-source `.ibooks` file format (IBA) - a derivative of epub 3.

####Marvin####
Marvin is another application and one of the few paid entries. It does not offer its own store and is mainly geared towards managing existing collections of digital publications compiled from various sources. Marvin only accepts epubs and offers to convert incompatible file formats using third party software package Calibre.

####Aldiko####
Aldiko is both a storefront and an e-reader for Android which supports epub and PDF. As such it is comparable to Apple's iBooks. There is a paid version which offers some extra features (annotation, removal of advertisements) which the free version does not offer.

####Kindle####
Kindle is Amazon's tablet and smartphone counterpart to their physical e-readers (Kindle Paperwhite, etc.). The application is available for both iOS and Android. Books can be bought from inside the application on Android. On iOS it's less straightforward due to the restrictions Apple places on in-app purchasing. Kindle for mobile devices only has support for Amazon's proprietary file formats (AZW, KF8) and PDF. Epubs have to be converted using software like for example Calibre, in order for Kindle to be able to import the files into its library. The application is able to sync its library so that a collection of e-books is available on both the Kindle e-reader and in the application. It is not possible to copy-paste. 

####Kobo####
Kobo, like Amazon, produces e-reader hardware and also has a large bookstore. As such the apps they offer for Android and iOS are largely complementary to the e-reader companion devices manufactured by Kobo. Libraries are synced across devices, provided all the content is bought in Kobo's bookstore. Kobo supports both epub and PDF files.



###PC software
A plethora of desktop applications exist that allow users to read epubs. Of the five applications mentioned above only Aldiko is not available on desktops and iBooks is a Mac-only application. Kobo and Kindle both offer Windows and Mac versions of their software. The functionality is similar to that of the mobile versions.

Calibre is an application of note here, because it's an e-book management suite with many features. It offers tools for managing large collections of e-books, but also converts files to many different formats (e-books and other text based formats)[^calibre-file-formats]. Viewing all major e-books file formats, as well as editing epubs and AZWs is also part of the software package.


####Calibre
Calibre is an extensible application that uses plugins. It is an e-book management suite with many features. It offers tools for managing large collections of e-books, but also converts files to many different formats (both e-book and other text based formats)[^calibre-file-formats]. Viewing all major e-book file formats, as well as editing epubs and AZWs is also part of the software package.

####Adobe Digital Editions
Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) is an e-book reader and management tool which is able to read epub and PDF. Support for epub3 is incomplete though, though Adobe claims support for all the important features is present - without elaborating what those important features are. <!-- grammatically unclear, but on top of that it's not clear in content either. However here is my attempt to clean it up, "Support for epub3 is incomplete. Although Adobe claims support for all the important features is present, it doesn't elaborate on what those important features are. " --> ADE also integrates with many e-readers offering syncing possibilities. So a library managed with ADE could in theory be synced with a compatible e-reader.[^ade-readers]


###Web platforms
There are some web platforms for reading epubs online, their popularity is hard to gauge. A project called [Bookworm](http://oreilly.com/bookworm/) <!--  add as to footnote too so it's visible in the printed version -->, developed by Threepress , was closed by O'Reilly Labs in 2012. The reason given for the closure mentions an "interesting experiment" but also due to the dramatic changes in the e-book ecosystem over the past few years. [Booki.sh](https://booki.sh), another project is still online and offers a complete library of e-books which may be view and stored online. It doesn't appear to operate commercially though, the ability to purchase books was removed in June 2013.[^bookish-blog]

###Browser applications
Apart from web applications, several browser extensions exist allowing users to read epubs in their web browser. These extensions are most likely more of a convenience method in order to quickly (pre)view e-books, instead of being fully-fledged solutions for reading e-books comparable to the functionality of e-readers.


####Readium
Readium is a project by several publishers and technology companies aiming to provide a reference system, a collection of best practices, for rendering epub 3 publications.[^readium-goals] The Readium Project offers a range of tools for online and offline use, mainly geared towards software developers. One of the tools is a browser extension [^readium-extension] for the Google Browser. After installing the extension offers an epub reader inside the browser window.

####epubReader
epubReader is similar to the browser extension offered by Readium, the main difference is the supported browser, as epubReader is only compatible with Mozilla Firefox.

##File formats
###Reflowable documents (epub and AZW)
The history of the modern e-book can be traced back to the late 1990s with the establishment of the *Open eBook Forum* tasked with the creation of the *Open eBook Publication Structure* (OEBPS). Microsoft was heavily involved in the development of what became the *Open eBook* based partly on technology created by a company called SoftBook Press.[^businessweek-ebooks] SoftBook Press developed the format, based on XML and XHTML, as a companion to their e-reader. The *Open eBook* specification had its first release in 1999 and was later renamed to epub when the standard reached the 2.0 version milestone under the auspices of the *International Digital Publishing Forum* (IDPF, formerly the *Open eBook Forum*).[^interoperability-of-ebook-formats] The epub 2.0 standard has support for basic styling, custom fonts, etc.[^epub2-specification]

At the beginning of Amazon's foray into the world of digital publishing, the online bookseller chose not to use epub but opted to buy a French company responsible for the development of *Mobipocket* and the MOBI file format. One of the main reasons for this move was the widely supported Digital Rights Management (DRM) engineered by *Mobipocket*. [^amazon-aquires-mobipocket] Technically, the MOBI file-format is partly based on *PalmDOC*, an ebook file-format readable on PDAs running the OS developed by Palm Inc., with added support for the guidelines taken from the *Open eBook* standard.[^mobileread-palmdoc] Mobilepocket and Amazon then developed the format further in order for it to be used exclusively with *Mobipocket* and, later, Amazon *Kindle* e-readers. The MOBI format is now called AZW by Amazon, their generic term for all e-books released by the company.[^amazon-azw]

Nowadays, roughly two generations of widely used e-book formats exist. One generation is based on the epub 2.0 standard as introduced in 2007, or an earlier version released under the *Open eBook* moniker. Amazon's MOBI/AZW is an example of this, as it's still widely used and supported by the *Kindle* e-readers. The other generally implements features from the epub 3.0 standard, while often remaining backwardly compatible with older versions and subsets of epub 2.0 and even 1.0 to a certain extent. epub 3.0, released in 2011[^epub3-specification], brought support for HTML 5 (as opposed to XHTML 1.1 in epub 2.0), more advanced styling using CSS3, scripting (discouraged in epub 2.0) and easy embedding of video and audio, amongst others.[^epub3-changes]
epub 3.0 forms the basis of most of the e-book file formats available today. Most of the current file formats, like Amazon's AZW3/KF8 and Apple's iBooks, implement most of the epub standard, mainly to benefit from the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications, while adding their own proprietary extensions.[^amazon-kf8][^ibooks-author] These extensions are mainly geared towards extra support for more advanced (fixed) layout options, rich media integration and DRM.[^ibooks-photo-blocks][^ibooks-multicolumn][^amazon-kf8] An AZW3/KF8 e-book is basically an epub 3.0 wrapped in Amazon's DRM. For backwards compatibility a MOBI version of the publication is generally also present in the e-book package. [^azw3kf8-breakdown]

Of course epub 3.0 files without proprietary extensions exist as well and are sold to various commercial channels. In addition to their own iBooks file format, Apple also sells epubs in their online store. [^epub-seller-apple] Other major players include Kobo, Google Play and Barnes & Nobles' NookPress.[^epub-seller-kobo] [^epub-google-play] [^epub-seller-barnes] 

<!-- comment: an overwhelming amount of terminology and formats introduced. Perhaps we should introduce some terms earlier in the toolkit? -->

###Other formats
The aforementioned file formats may be categorised as reflowable documents, although there is support for fixed layouts. Of course there are different ways to disseminate electronic publications, one way is exporting a document as a PDF, but there are also more content specific file formats like the *Comic Book Archive*, support for these file formats by e-readers varies greatly.

###Alternative ways of publishing
A single downloadable package like epub might be a great vehicle to monetise, but there could be other factors to consider when publishing. A consistent design and uniform interactivity across devices could be a requirement, in which case a reflowable document might not be the ideal solution. Some publishers opt to develop their own (mobile) applications, like The Guardian's iOS version of their newspaper, the amplified eBooks by Penguin or the children's book by Purple Carrot. [^guardian-ios] [^penguin-amplified] [^purple-carrot-publication] These solutions offer fine-grained control over user interaction and consistency of design, but come with the extra cost of hiring a development team to engineer the application. Also, publishing for different platforms is not that straightforward. Code written specifically with the iOS SDK (Software Development Kit) in mind will likely require a lot of editing before it's ready to run on the Android platform. Portability is another issue, it's fairly easy to transfer an epub to another device, however application binaries are not that easily passed around, mostly due to the relatively closed nature of mobile operating systems.

Lastly, why not just publish essays, articles or even whole books on a website? The wealth of weblogs and other publishing platforms shows that this is a viable form of publishing. Monetising is less straightforward, most websites generate income by showing advertisements or sponsored articles. Paid membership is also used as a business model by some websites, like *De Correspondent*.[^de-correspondent] One of the major downsides is that content will only be available online and cannot be easily passed around as a single unit of information like an epub or a PDF.
