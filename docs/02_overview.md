# 02 Overview 

## Why this toolkit

This toolkit aims to provide a practical guide on how to develop epubs
for publishers as well as for anyone else interested in this subject
matter. It will give insight into the preconditions of electronic <!-- In the last meeting we raised the issue of using digital vs. electronic. Although the correct term is "electronic", the term "digital" is used in the title of this project. If everyone agrees, we could add a note to clarify this --> publishing, providing open-source tools where possible, and allow
publishers of the art and culture sector to navigate the diverse and
complex landscape of digital publishing in a more informed way.

## Whom is this toolkit written for?

You may be a publisher, an experienced programmer, a designer or someone
who is just starting out. You probably identify with or work in the art
fields. You may be hoping to gain answers, knowledge, get tips, and
consult various resources. This toolkit <!-- Toolkit or toolkit? --> intends to provide them all. The
overall focus is on pragmatic solutions for digital publishers within
the art and cultural sector. No prior knowledge of creating an epub is
required â€“ with that said, a familiarity of various computer software is helpful, as is the willingness to learn and the inquisitive curiosity to look beyond this book for certain answers. This publication is not a tutorial on how to make an electronic publication, it just
gives you some guidance on how to make a first attempt in creating an electronic publication.

## What culture shock to expect 

As mentioned before "you must change your life", so there might a little culture shock reading through this document. If electronic
publishing will merely remain an afterthought in the production chain
and product portfolio, the change might be light. If electronic
publishing will become just as important as print, the change may be
radical. What this means is that if you want to make visual electronic
publications, you should be willing to change your current way of
working and gradually get used to the offered but less common
alternatives.

## How to use this toolkit (check chpt \#s)

This toolkit will help you to develop epubs, specifically art and design
publications, that overall make more use of different fonts, graphics
and layout than plain text, for example novels. Chapter 3 will give a general introduction of these publications and sketches out various scenarios to develop epubs. Issues and opportunities of going electronic will be discussed, as well as strengths and limitations of particular reader hardwares and softwares, file formats and lastly distribution platforms. Chapters 4 offers a practical, how-to guidance for workflows (structured and per scenario) and designing epubs for the various scenarios addressed earlier in chapter 3. Chapter 5 illustrates the concepts with concrete examples from the Digital Publishing Toolkit program.

## Who worked on this toolkit

This publication is part of the Digital Publishing Toolkit research
program, based on recommendations from practical experiences throughout
the collaboration with four Dutch art, design and research publishers.
Thus, all disciplines were represented from publisher to developer to
designer.
