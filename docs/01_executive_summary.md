# 01 Executive summary

## Electronic publishing requires deeper changes in your work than you might have expected

"You must change your life" - borrowing from philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, this could be the summary of our message for art and design oriented publishers, writers, editors and designers transitioning from traditional book making to electronic publishing or - more typically - hybrid print and electronic publishing. Hybrid publishing will sooner or later confront them with the following: (a) rethinking of traditional publication formats (eg a catalog), (b) rethinking of editorial and production workflows and (c) rethinking of distribution.

## Change is minor for scientific and mass publishers

That said, there are exceptions. Workflow changes can be minor for
publishers who already accomplish all their editorial work in highly
structured digital document formats (like XML or databases); but
typically, this is only the case in scientific and technology-oriented
publishing. Changes can also be minor for larger publishers that can
afford outsourcing. Making an electronic (digital) publication next to a printed publication then is simply a matter of paying an external service provider such as a document engineering company or a media design bureau for turning a Microsoft Word or InDesign file into an e-book [gl]. This process can be quick if the book is visually simple - such as a novel or a textbook with little illustrations - and economic if many e-books will be sold.

## Change is major for small, arts-oriented publishers

Since this Toolkit is for publishers who (a) publish visually
oriented books in (b) mostly small editions (typically up to 500), it
proposes an alternative route. Neither a complex internal IT
infrastructure, nor costly outsourcing will be viable solutions for
them. And, to disappoint a common expectation, there is no magic
software button that will turn a print book design into an electronic
publication. Since the two media are so different, with their own specific editorial and visual design needs, such a button won't materialize in the future either. Hybrid publishing will ultimately require editorial work to change, both technologically as well as editorial concepts.

For art and design publications, the challenge of going electronic is
greater compared to other fields of publishing for a number of reasons: -
visually oriented publications are still more difficult to technically
realize in the electronic medium when designing for a multitude of
different reading devices and e-book platforms; - small publishers are
under even higher pressure to keep projects within low costs - but
having to publish in one or more media will increase costs unless one
accomplishes as much work as possible in medium-independent ways; -
small editions make it necessary that electronic publications are
sustainable: they should not need constant investment into technical
maintenance and version updates.

## Industry promises versus reality

We face a major contrast between computer industry promises and
the reality of the new medium. On the one hand, publishers, editors,
designers and artists tend to overestimate interactive and multimedia
possibilities of electronic publishing. These new possibilities do
exist, but in most cases cause higher development costs and remain
specific to one particular technical reading platform.

<!-- I'd add that some of these 'new' possibilities are not that new as Voyager company, among others, was experimenting with them during the '90s. Also, it's not necessarely true that these possibilities are of an actual interest for readers/users.

On the other hand, publishers tend to underestimate how even technically simple and seemingly banal types of electronic publications can force a rethinking of traditional publishing formats (such as: the anthology, the catalogue, the periodical). Rethought formats may be the greatest opportunity offered by electronic publishing: for example, splitting up a traditional exhibition catalogue into interrelated micro-monographs that people can download and read as individual e-books.

## What this Toolkit provides

Going electronic - or going hybrid - means that you need to change the
way you work in the whole process from manuscript to publication. The
software tools currently in use, from word processors like Microsoft
Word to desktop publishing suites like InDesign, were created for the
analog or Desktop-Publishing world. Although it's possible to create
electronic publications from those Microsoft Word and InDesign files that are
likely the standard in your publishing workflow, it will be painful,
slow, inefficient and expensive in most cases. This Toolkit describes
technical alternatives because it is primarily aimed at small edition
publishers who, in most cases, cannot afford to outsource e-book design to external service providers because this would double design costs.

This Toolkit describes easy-to-use tools and work methods for editing
and designing hybrid print and electronic publications. These tools and methods do require some effort, but are for everyone: publishing houses, editors, writers, designers, artists and anyone who is curious.

This Toolkit has a particular (but not exclusive) focus on epub3 as an
electronic publication format and on Markdown as a word processing
format because of the specific needs of small edition publishers in the art and design field: low cost, ease of use, sustainable and
platform-independence. These recommendations result from our practical
experience in collaborating with four Dutch art, design and research
publishers on electronic publication projects.
