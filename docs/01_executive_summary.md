## Electronic publishing requires deeper changes in your work than you might have expected

"You must change your life" - borrowing from philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, this is could be the summary of our message for arts- and design-oriented publishers, writers, editors and designers transitioning from traditional book making to electronic publishing or - more typically - hybrid print and electronic publishing. Hybrid publishing will, sooner or later, confront them with the following: (a) a rethinking of traditional publication formats, (b) rethinking of editorial and production workflows and (c) rethinking of distribution. 

## Change is minor for scientific and mass publishers

That said, there are exceptions. Workflow changes can be minor for publishers who already accomplish all their editorial work in highly structured digital document formats (like XML or databases); but typically, this is only the case in scientific and technology-oriented publishing. Changes can also be minor for larger publishers that can afford outsourcing. Making an e-book next to a print book then is simply a matter of paying an external service provider such as a document engineering company or a media design bureau for turning a Word or InDesign file into an ebook. This process can be quick if the book is visually simple, such as a novel or textbook, and economic if many e-books will be sold.

## Change is major for small, arts-oriented publishers

But since this Toolkit is for publishers who (a) publish visually oriented books in (b) mostly small editions (typically between 500 and 5000), it proposes an alternative route. Neither a complex internal IT infrastructure, nor costly outsourcing will be viable solutions for them. And, to disappoint a common expectation, there is no magic software button that will turn a print book design into an electronic book. Since the two media are so different, with their own specific editorial and visual design needs, such a button won't materialize in the future either. Hybrid publishing will ultimately require editorial work to change, both technologicaly and as regards to editorial concepts. 

For arts and design publications, the challenge of going electronic is greater than for other fields of publishing for a number of reasons: 
- visually oriented publications are still more difficult to technically realize in the electronic medium when designing for a multitude of different reading devices and e-book platforms;
- small publishers are under even higher pressure to keep projects within low costs - but having to publish in one more medium will increase costs unless one accomplishes as much work as possible in medium-agnostic ways;
- small editions make it necessary that electronic publications are sustainable:  they should not need constant investment into technical maintenance and version updates.

## Industry promises versus reality

These factors can amount to a major contrast between computer industry promises and the reality of the new medium. On the one hand, publishers, editors, designers and artists tend to overestimate interactive and multimedia possibilities of electronic publishing. These new possibilities do exist, but in most cases cause higher development costs and remain specific to one particular technical reading platform. 

## Hidden opportunities

On the other hand, publishers tend to underestimate how even technically simple and seemingly banal types of electronic publications can force a rethinking of traditional publishing formats (such as: the anthology, the catalogue, the periodical). Rethought formats may be the greatest opportunity offered by electronic publishing: for example, splitting up a traditional exhibition catalogue into micro monographs that people can download and read as individual e-books.

## What this Toolkit provides

Going electronic - or going hybrid - means that you need to change the way you work in the whole process from manuscript to publication. The software tools currently in use, from word processors like Microsoft Word to desktop publishing suites like InDesign, were created for the analog world. Although it's possible to create electronic publications from those Word and InDesign files that are likely the standard in your publishing workflow, it will be painful, slow, inefficient and expensive in most cases. This Toolkit describes technical alternatives because it is primarily aimed at small edition publishers who, in most cases, cannot afford to outsource e-book design to external service providers because this would double design costs. 

This Toolkit describes easy-to-use tools and work methods for editing and designing hybrid print and electronic publications. These tools and methods are for everyone: publishing houses, editors, writers, designers and artists. 

This Toolkit has a particular (but not exclusive) focus on epub as an electronic publication format and on Markdown as a word processing format because of the specific needs of small edition publishers in the arts and design field: low cost, ease of use, sustainability, platform-independence. These recommendations result from our practical experience in collaborating with four Dutch art, design and research publishers on electronic publication projects.
