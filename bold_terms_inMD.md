Technically, the MOBI file format is based partly on PalmDOC, an ebook file format readable on PDAs running the operating system developed by Palm, Inc., and with added support for guidelines taken from the Open eBook standard.[^mobileread-palmdoc] The MOBI format was further developed to be used exclusively with Mobipocket e-readers, and later with Amazon's Kindle e-readers. Finally, Amazon renamed the MOBI format AZW (presumably an **acronym** for 'Amazon Word'), which is now the generic term for all ebooks released by the company.[^amazon-azw]

Some manufacturers of e-readers also offer more expensive models, such as Amazon's Kindle Fire (and Fire HD) or Barnes & Noble's NOOK Tablet (and NOOK HD+). However these models are not really e-readers anymore, but full-fledged, small-sized tablets. Instead of e-paper, they have backlit color LCD screens, a standard feature of tablets such as Apple's iPad and Samsung's Galaxy Tab. Often these models use a version of the **Android** operating system, in contrast to the traditional monochrome e-readers which use their own operating system, usually derived from a version of **Linux**. Conversely, Samsung's Galaxy Note and Apple's iPad Mini can be seen as these tablet manufacturers' answer to the smaller-sized e-reading tablets.

Our project for nai010 Publishers included two technical components. The first is a mobile web application, called My Highlights, which allows a user to browse a large collection and create an EPUB based on a personal selection of catalogue texts on art works from the collection of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. The other is a set of plug-ins for the popular web content management system WordPress, extending the functionality of the WordPress JSON REST **API** (WP-AP)[^wp-api] and facilitating the generation of EPUBs directly from a WordPress database. (The latter is for the most part a packaged version of the **CakePHP** EPUB component that builds on Asbjørn Grandt's PHPePub.)

   TERM: Application
01_introduction.md
You may be a publisher, a designer, or someone who is just starting out with making books. You probably identify with, or work in, the arts. You may be hoping to find answers, gain knowledge, pick up some tips, and consult various resources. This Toolkit intends to provide all of that. The overall focus is on pragmatic solutions for publishers within the sector of art and culture. No prior knowledge of creating an ebook is required. Having said that, a familiarity with various computer software **applications** is certainly helpful, as is the willingness to learn, and an inquisitive curiosity to look beyond this guide for specific answers. This publication is not meant as a complete tutorial on how to create an electronic publication; rather, it intends to provide the reader with basic guidance on how to make a first attempt at creating such a publication. 


   TERM: App store

   TERM: ASCII
02_the_basics.md
One of the most widespread forms of electronic publishing consists of scanning existing paper books and converting them into digital media such as images, electronic texts, or an ebook. **Optical character recognition (OCR)** is often used to convert the printed text of a book into a digital text format such as **ASCII** or **Unicode**. After this conversion the text can be re-formatted, searched, or processed using other software applications. Examples of organizations or projects for book scanning on a large scale are: Project Gutenberg,[^Project-Gutenberg1] the Million Book Project,[^Million-Book-Project] Google Books,[^Google-Books] and the Open Content Alliance.[^Open-Content-Alliance] 


   TERM: AZW
04_ereading_technologies.md
There are various software applications for tablets and smartphones, some of which are 'companion apps' to well-known e-reader devices such as Amazon's Kindle and Kobo's range of e-reader hardware. Other applications were not developed for specific e-reader devices but are integrated into a storefront, such as Apple's **iBooks** and Aldiko. The applications generally support EPUB2 and EPUB3, though some require the user to convert files into a proprietary file format before the document can be opened, such as the Kindle e-reader device and application which support only Amazon's proprietary file formats (**AZW**, **KF8**, MOBI) along with **plain text** and PDF. 


   TERM: Bandwidth
08_guide_workflow.md
This also provides a solution for the problem of the publication's file size. In most cases, due to current limitations in **bandwidth** and storage space, an art catalogue is difficult to convert one-to-one to an electronic publication which can be downloaded within a reasonable amount of time. Therefore it is advisable to split up the publication into smaller sub-publications, such as monographic micro-ebooks on single art works, or collections of articles from which each reader can individually choose, thereby automatically generating a customized ebook. Modularized content can also lead to different commercial strategies, for example by offering parts of a publication through an 'in-app' download. An example of this is a project by the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, which resulted in the MyHighlights app. <!--internal link to 12--> 


   TERM: Binary
02_the_basics.md
At the most basic level, all files in an ebook are nothing but bitstreams (streams of **binary** code: zeros and ones). As we have seen, the great novelty in the world of electronic art books is that, based on standardized but flexible structures, the same content can be published in a wide variety of formats. This not only depends on the capabilities of the output (reading/viewing/listening) device, but also on the function of the book, such as a dictionary, a study book, a reference work, a catalogue, or a work of fiction. 


   TERM: Bit
08_guide_workflow.md
* Other standard file formats creatively used and abused as document formats for visual books include: animated GIF graphics files for the digital equivalent of flip books, **MP4** video files displaying a book with pages that turn by themselves, MP3 audio files triggering abstract art on the volume meter display of an audio player, JPEG files with encoding artifacts of corrupted **bits**, etc.[^other-formats] Such files are relatively easy to create, and there are substantial communities of artists/designers actively working with such media. However, in most cases, the resulting works will only be viewable in web browsers, not on e-reader devices and applications. They also cannot be distributed through electronic bookstores. 


   TERM: BitTorrent
05_distribution_platforms.md
Sites like The Pirate Bay offer every imaginable type of digital media for download: films, music, computer games and software, and of course electronic books. The content listed on The Pirate Bay and other sites which make use of the **BitTorrent** **protocol** tends toward the mainstream: Hollywood films, pop music, and non-fiction and technical handbook literature as well as fantasy and science fiction. Since these sites are widely used and provide up-to-date download statistics, and since their technology (BitTorrent) depends on user participation for downloads to remain available, they provide a great deal of insight into which titles are truly popular among readers, as well as the popularity of ebooks in general. For example, at a particular moment in June 2014, the book *Atlas of Ancient Worlds* had been downloaded more than 2000 times in 48 hours (in comparison, the most popular film - an episode of the TV series *Game of Thrones* - had been downloaded more than 70,000 times). 


   TERM: Blog
03_genres_of_publication.md
New genres of publication will continue to emerge as a result of the ongoing digitization of the publishing industry. These could fall outside of what we would normally consider a 'book': for example, short pamphlets, poems, essays, sketches, or - in the world of digital media - apps, a series of tweets, a **blog**, etc. Interactive approaches, similar to adventure games, where the reader is able to control the narrative or to build or customize the publication, have also been imagined and developed since the late 1980s. Up until now, this type of electronic publication (usually known as 'hyperfiction' or 'e-literature') has remained a marginal phenomenon, but one should not exclude the possibility of a resurgence in new contexts.

The first, most obvious advantage of 'going electronic' with research publications is that it makes things easier for users: electronic texts make it possible for researchers, students and other readers to search, copy and paste text in a simple and straightforward way. Also, the **datasets** used in the research can be included within the publication, allowing more serious readers and researchers to engage directly with the research material itself. For publishers, making texts available digitally offers huge advantages in terms of accessibility, particularly on an international level, since distribution of ebooks is not limited by logistical issues of shipment and storage. On the other hand there are also specific problems related to digital research publications. One of these has to do with citation references: without fixed page numbers, there is no standard way of referring to a specific part of the ebook in another publication. This is one reason why scientific ebooks are still often issued as PDFs. 


   TERM: Decompress
06_guide_DIY.md
An EPUB file is in fact a ZIP archive, but with the file extension '.epub' instead of '.zip'. As such, it is a compressed collection of HTML files, style sheets and images, much like the files found on a website, compiled together with some extra files which define the format and structure of the documents so that an e-reader can display them. Any file archiving software that can handle ZIP files can open and **decompress** an EPUB. In some cases this can be done simply by renaming the '.epub' extension to '.zip'.[^epub-zipping-process] 


   TERM: Desktop Publishing
01_introduction.md
'Going electronic' - or going hybrid - requires changing the way you work during the publishing process, from delivered manuscript to final publication. The software tools currently in use, from **word processors** such as Microsoft Word to **desktop publishing** suites such as Adobe InDesign, were created for the world of analog print and desktop publishing. Although it is entirely possible to create electronic publications from Microsoft Word documents [![Bloglink](images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/03/28/converting-a-docx-directly-to-epub-using-calibre/ "Link to blog post: Converting a Docx directly to EPUB using Calibre")(*Converting a Docx directly to EPUB using Calibre*) or InDesign documents [![Bloglink](images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/05/21/epub-development-in-adobe-indesign-cs6/ "Link to blog post: NOTES ON EPUB DEVELOPMENT IN ADOBE INDESIGN CS6")(*Notes on EPUB Development in Adobe InDesign CS6*), which are likely to be the standard format used in existing publishing workflows, in most cases this will be a painful, slow, inefficient and expensive process. This Toolkit focuses instead on do-it-yourself (DIY) technical alternatives. Firstly because the Toolkit is primarily aimed at publishers who, in most cases, cannot afford to outsource ebook design to external service providers; secondly because it is aimed at those who wish to keep the design process in their own hands.

- Low-budget, small-edition, visually-oriented publications that are designed in-house will require more significant changes in work methods than big-budget publications for which the **ebook** design can be outsourced. 


   TERM: EPUB
01_introduction.md
Various types of electronic publications may be subject to different kinds of change. Still, the change will always radical. An exhibition catalog for instance can be split up into interrelated micro-monographs which readers can download and read as individual ebooks. An ebook can be assembled from a variety of sources selected by individual readers, as is currently the case with Wikipedia, where visitors to the website can compile their own collection of Wikipedia articles and export this compilation to an **EPUB** or **PDF** document using the [Book Creator tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Books). 


   TERM: E-paper
02_the_basics.md
New electronic technologies allow for a variety of publication outlets, bringing new opportunities as well as new challenges. Page numbering and indexing for example, which for centuries were essential book-making concepts, are problematic in electronic publications, where page numbers are unstable or even non-existent.[^bible] Fixed page numbers and indexes referring to page numbers have traditionally allowed readers, writers and researchers to refer to the same publication (or at least the same edition) across time and space. However, in an electronic environment with non-fixed screen sizes this is much more complicated. Though the text itself usually remains fixed, as the original text file exists independently from its delivery format (**e-paper**, **LCD**, paper), the actual visual layout or representation in each format can vary substantially, making it much harder to refer to the location of a passage in the text. The challenge becomes even greater if we widen our ambition to include not only tables, references and notes but also pictures, audio and video, and hyperlinks. 


   TERM: E-reader
01_introduction.md
After a basic exploration in Chapter 2 of publishing in general and electronic publishing in particular, in Chapter 3 we provide a general introduction to electronic publishing, sketching out various scenarios on how to develop electronic publications and discussing a number of issues and opportunities in 'going electronic'. In Chapter 4 we focus on the strengths and limitations of various specific types of **e-reader** hardware and software as well as different file formats, before moving on to describe in Chapter 5 a number of distribution platforms. In Chapter 6 we provide a step-by-step guide to creating your own EPUB. Chapter 7 offers a practical, how-to guide for workflows (both generally structured and specific to each scenario) and finally in Chapter 8 we explore the design of electronic publications for the various scenarios addressed earlier. Finally, in Chapter 9 we look into the future of electronic publishing. The manual also includes a description of the software developed within the different project groups, and a glossary of terms. 


   TERM: File
01_introduction.md
Having said that, there are exceptions. Workflow changes can be also minor for publishers who already do all their editorial work in highly structured digital document formats such as **XML** or databases; but this is typically only the case in scientific and technology-oriented publishing. Changes may also be minor for larger publishers who can afford outsourcing. Generating an electronic (digital) publication in parallel to a printed publication is then simply a matter of paying an external service provider, such as a document engineering company or a media design agency, to turn a Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign **file** into an ebook. This process can be quick if the book is visually simple - such as a novel or a textbook with few illustrations - and economically worthwhile if many ebooks will be sold.

   TERM: Formatting
02_the_basics.md
In the electronic processing of texts, this hierarchical ordering of words into sentences, sentences into paragraphs and so on, as well as additional reading aids such bold or italic text, is made possible by using specific **formatting** codes. This process is called **markup** and the codes are called markup elements. It goes without saying that all these markup elements require stable definitions and clear relationships if they are to be of any use. In order to establish which markup is allowed and how it should be used, **markup languages** were defined.

   TERM: Graphical User Interface

In this guide we will use the Old English epic poem *Beowulf* as a working example. The text is available from the Project Gutenberg website in a variety of formats (including EPUB). The 'plain text' version is the complete text of the poem in a single file with no styling whatsoever (no fonts, font sizes, formatting such as bold or italic, etc.). We will use this text to show how a simple conversion to EPUB can be done. Before starting, first download and install Pandoc.[^pandoc-installation-page] Pandoc is a 'command-line' program, as opposed to a **graphical user interface** environment, so once the software is installed you will not see a desktop icon with which to 'open' it. In the following step-by-step guide we will explain how to use the tool. 


   TERM: Graphics Interchange Format

   TERM: HTML
02_the_basics.md
With the emergence of computer networks and the increasing need to standardize texts for multiple usages, an international ISO standard was defined in 1982, known as Standardized General Markup Language (SGML). This was an extremely important development, as it established a logical-semantic approach, in other words a strict division between the *conceptual* structure and formatting of the text, and the final visual *representation* of that structure and formatting. This is radically different from the **'What You See Is What You Get' (WYSIWYG)** markup languages used in word processors such as Microsoft Word, WordPerfect or OpenOffice, where text which is marked up in a certain way (such as italic or bold) is immediately displayed that way, so that there is no visible distinction between the conceptual structure and the visual representation. SGML and its derivatives, **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language, used mainly in web design) and the expanded XML (Extensible Markup Language), allow instead for formatting *concepts* such as 'emphasis' or 'strong emphasis', (rather than 'italic' or 'bold') as well as structuring concepts such as 'chapter heading' or 'quotation', to be linked logically to specific display representations for each concept in a separate list of definitions known as a **style sheet** (such as **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** in web design).

Currently there are roughly two 'generations' of widely used ebook formats. The first generation is based on the EPUB2 standard as introduced in 2007 (or on an earlier version released under the Open eBook specification): for example, Amazon's MOBI/AZW format. The second generation usually implements features from the EPUB3 standard, while often remaining backward-compatible with older versions and subsets of EPUB2 (and to a certain extent earlier specifications as well). EPUB3, released in 2011, introduced new features such as support for **HTML5** (whereas EPUB2 supported XHTML), the more advanced Cascading Style Sheets specification CSS3, scripting (which had been discouraged in EPUB2) and easy embedding of video and audio.[^epub3-changes] Most ebook file formats available today are based on EPUB3, including proprietary formats such as Amazon's AZW and Apple's iBooks.[^amazon-kf8] For compatibility with older e-readers, the ebook package usually also includes a MOBI file.

'You must change your life' - borrowing from the philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, this could be the summary of our message to art-oriented and design-oriented publishers, writers, editors and designers who are currently transitioning from traditional book making to electronic publishing or - more typically - **hybrid publishing** of print and electronic formats. Hybrid publishing will sooner or later confront them with the need to re-think traditional publication formats, editorial and production workflows, and distribution.

The process of creating an EPUB from scratch is similar to that of developing a simple website. The main difference is that while websites can and often do embed material located elsewhere in the **internet**, an EPUB is 'self-contained' and made for offline reading. This means that all pages or images displayed must be part of the collection. Making an EPUB from scratch, or manually, is useful for creating small and simple publications, for creating or modifying publications that make extensive use of the particularities of the EPUB format, or in order to explore and better understand the functionalities and inner workings of this format, which is what we will now do.

Instead of e-paper, they have backlit color LCD screens, a standard feature of tablets such as Apple's iPad and Samsung's Galaxy Tab. Often these models use a version of the **Android** operating system, in contrast to the traditional monochrome e-readers which use their own operating system, usually derived from a version of **Linux**.

03_genres_of_publication.md
Independently of the different genres listed above, we can distinguish three levels of electronic publishing. The scope of electronic publishing ranges from the simple conversion of a paper book, to an electronic publication (for example, a PDF of the print edition as an ebook), to full-scale electronic publications which incorporate advanced digital formats such as video, or are published as 'native apps' (applications developed for a particular platform or device). When we consider the different genres of publishing from this perspective, the role and use of **metadata** also becomes an important factor.

**2. One-to-many**: the publication has a variety of appearances, depending on the context and the available presentation media (type and size of screen/paper). The book is offered in formats such as print, EPUB, PDF, **MOBI**, web, each with an appearance and functionality suitable to the format being used. 


   TERM: Mobipocket

When Amazon made its entrance in the world of digital publishing, the online bookseller opted not to follow the EPUB standard, but instead to purchase a French company known as **Mobipocket** which had developed another format called MOBI with proprietary Mobipocket Reader software that ran on some personal digital assistants (**PDA**) and other hardware.[^amazon-acquires-mobipocket] One of the main reasons for this choice was the fact that, unlike EPUB, Mobipocket's products provided full support for **digital rights management (DRM)**.

   TERM: Monitor
04_ereading_technologies.md
For viewing arts and design publications, tablets with color LCD screens are far more suitable than e-readers with monochrome e-paper displays. The color fidelity of the newest tablet displays offered by Apple and Samsung is comparable to that of professional **monitors** used by photographers and graphic designers. However, the tablet's color screen also has some serious drawbacks: backlit LCD screens cause a great deal more eye fatigue than either printed paper or e-paper, while viewing outdoors greatly diminishes image quality. Another issue with tablets is battery life: though newer models continue to provide significant improvements, their relatively large power consumption means they are still no competition in this respect for e-readers, which boast an average battery life of up to several weeks. 


   TERM: Monochrome
04_ereading_technologies.md
E-readers became widely known with the introduction of the Amazon Kindle in 2007. Standard e-readers, unlike tablets, are only suitable for reading books and are relatively inexpensive. An important characteristic of e-reader devices is the use of a **monochrome** display technology known as electronic paper (e-paper). Electronic paper is designed to mimic as closely as possible the characteristics of paper, and has a very low energy consumption in comparison with other mobile displays such as the LCD screens used on tablets. The current generation of e-paper is not capable of rendering complex motion, therefore animations and videos cannot be viewed on these devices. Also, the monochrome display means that the current generation of e-readers is mainly suitable for text-based publications, such as novels or research publications. 


   TERM: MP3

   TERM: MP4

* Other standard file formats creatively used and abused as document formats for visual books include: animated GIF graphics files for the digital equivalent of flip books, **MP4** video files displaying a book with pages that turn by themselves, MP3 audio files triggering abstract art on the volume meter display of an audio player, JPEG files with encoding artifacts of corrupted **bits**, etc.[^other-formats] Such files are relatively easy to create, and there are substantial communities of artists/designers actively working with such media. However, in most cases, the resulting works will only be viewable in web browsers, not on e-reader devices and applications. They also cannot be distributed through electronic bookstores. 


   TERM: MultiMarkdown
07_workflows.md
In this example, the tag '\#' defines a top-level heading, '\#\#' a second-level heading, '\_' italic text, '\*\*' bold text, and '\>' a block quote. Markdown also provides tags for defining lists, embedded images, and links. The popular extended version **MultiMarkdown** provides further support for footnotes, tables, mathematical formulas, cross-references, bibliographies and definition lists. Using simple Open Source conversion applications such as Pandoc, text formatted using Markdown can be automatically converted to well-structured HTML, EPUB, PDF, **RTF** or other document formats, requiring no manual adjustments. 


   TERM: Multimedia
01_introduction.md
There is a stark contrast between the fanciful promises of the computer industry and the often harsh reality of the new digital medium. On one hand, publishers, editors, designers and artists tend to overestimate the interactive and **multimedia** possibilities of electronic publishing. These extra possibilities do exist, but in most cases bring with them higher development costs and remain specific to one particular technical platform.

   TERM: PDF
01_introduction.md
Various types of electronic publications may be subject to different kinds of change. Still, the change will always radical. An exhibition catalog for instance can be split up into interrelated micro-monographs which readers can download and read as individual ebooks. An ebook can be assembled from a variety of sources selected by individual readers, as is currently the case with Wikipedia, where visitors to the website can compile their own collection of Wikipedia articles and export this compilation to an **EPUB** or **PDF** document using the [Book Creator tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Books). 


   TERM: Pixel

   TERM: Plain text
04_ereading_technologies.md
There are various software applications for tablets and smartphones, some of which are 'companion apps' to well-known e-reader devices such as Amazon's Kindle and Kobo's range of e-reader hardware. Other applications were not developed for specific e-reader devices but are integrated into a storefront, such as Apple's **iBooks** and Aldiko. The applications generally support EPUB2 and EPUB3, though some require the user to convert files into a proprietary file format before the document can be opened, such as the Kindle e-reader device and application which support only Amazon's proprietary file formats (**AZW**, **KF8**, MOBI) along with **plain text** and PDF.

Sites like The Pirate Bay offer every imaginable type of digital media for download: films, music, computer games and software, and of course electronic books. The content listed on The Pirate Bay and other sites which make use of the **BitTorrent** **protocol** tends toward the mainstream: Hollywood films, pop music, and non-fiction and technical handbook literature as well as fantasy and science fiction. Since these sites are widely used and provide up-to-date download statistics, and since their technology (BitTorrent) depends on user participation for downloads to remain available, they provide a great deal of insight into which titles are truly popular among readers, as well as the popularity of ebooks in general. For example, at a particular moment in June 2014, the book *Atlas of Ancient Worlds* had been downloaded more than 2000 times in 48 hours (in comparison, the most popular film - an episode of the TV series *Game of Thrones* - had been downloaded more than 70,000 times). 


   TERM: Reflowable
02_the_basics.md
Most electronic reading devices support **reflowable** layout (also known as 'responsive' design), which means that the layout of the document is automatically adapted to fit the dimensions of the device. This works well for genres such as novels which usually consist only of text. However when the overall design cannot so easily be modified, for example if there are crucial relationships between the body text and images or other elements such as footnotes or tables (as is the case for art and design books as well as research publications), then the transposition from an existing print work to an electronic representation can pose some serious issues, which will be further addressed in the following chapters. 


   TERM: Resolution
03_genres_of_publication.md
Most art/design catalogues are image-based, and here lies the greatest challenge for electronic publishing in this genre. A publication containing many images with high **resolution** and high color fidelity will take a long time to download and will occupy a great deal of storage space on the user's device as well as the publisher's servers. And as download speeds and storage space continue to increase exponentially, there is of course an endless temptation to continue increasing the file size accordingly. 


   TERM: Rich Text Format

   TERM: Server-side scripting
08_guide_workflow.md
* Create separate low-resolution and high-resolution versions of the EPUB files, for example through **server-side scripting**. This can also be used as a business model: offer the low-resolution book cheap or for free, and the high-resolution version for the regular price.

Commercial providers of digital content can (and do) learn a lot from pirate platforms. For example, Netflix,[^Netflix] the most successful web service for **streaming** films and a growing competitor to paid cable television, has been known to decide which films to show based on the popularity of these films on The Pirate Bay.[^The-Pirate-Bay] 


   TERM: Style sheet
02_the_basics.md
With the emergence of computer networks and the increasing need to standardize texts for multiple usages, an international ISO standard was defined in 1982, known as Standardized General Markup Language (SGML). This was an extremely important development, as it established a logical-semantic approach, in other words a strict division between the *conceptual* structure and formatting of the text, and the final visual *representation* of that structure and formatting. This is radically different from the **'What You See Is What You Get' (WYSIWYG)** markup languages used in word processors such as Microsoft Word, WordPerfect or OpenOffice, where text which is marked up in a certain way (such as italic or bold) is immediately displayed that way, so that there is no visible distinction between the conceptual structure and the visual representation. SGML and its derivatives, **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language, used mainly in web design) and the expanded XML (Extensible Markup Language), allow instead for formatting *concepts* such as 'emphasis' or 'strong emphasis', (rather than 'italic' or 'bold') as well as structuring concepts such as 'chapter heading' or 'quotation', to be linked logically to specific display representations for each concept in a separate list of definitions known as a **style sheet** (such as **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** in web design). 


   TERM: Syntax
07_workflows.md
Markdown is a product of internet culture. It uses ad-hoc formatting signs commonly used in e-mail and chat platforms, and further popularized on blogging platforms, to provide a standardized, human-readable, user-friendly and well-structured document format, suitable for long-term storage and as a basic source for conversions to contemporary and future document formats. While its formatting **syntax** is simple, it is also both strict and unambiguous enough to allow multiple writers and editors to work on a single document without unnecessary confusion. Another advantage of Markdown is that it can be written and edited in any software application capable of processing basic text: unlike the proprietary file formats of Microsoft Word or other word processors, Markdown can be opened using a simple text editor. 


   TERM: Tablet
02_the_basics.md
An electronic text is generally understood as a text which is represented on a display screen of some sort. However, the most important difference between a paper text and an electronic text, in the context of hybrid publishing, is the notion that the electronic text becomes a structured file. As we have seen, the use of markup allows us to create different layouts, or representations, for different media. It is also crucial to understand that electronic publishing introduces a paradigm shift away from the page-centered culture of book printing. Book printing traditionally allows for various printing sizes, depending on the wishes of the author, designer and publisher. For example, when making an art book based on a collection of paintings or drawings, a decision will be made as to what the ideal book size is, and whether it should be printed in portrait or landscape format. In the world of screens however, it is no longer the designer who makes this choice, but the users - depending on whether they choose to read an electronic book on a smartphone, **tablet**, monochrome e-reader, personal computer, or whatever other device is available. Ideally, the electronic publication can be viewed all of these devices, without the need for any device-specific redesigns. 

03_genres_of_publication.md
Possibilities in this direction lie in offering high-quality 'zoomable' images and adding additional material such as video (documentary, animation, etc.), audio (interviews, lectures, etc.) or even 'interactive' media. Also, most **tablet** computers offer much better color fidelity than the printed page, a fact which can be used to good advantage when offering ebooks optimized specifically for reading on a tablet. A possible problematic issue is that such catalogues often require a fixed page layout: image and text that belong together should appear next to each other; however, changes in size (of the device or of the user's settings) affect the flow of content, so that the images and text will tend to 'drift apart'. 


   TERM: Tagging
03_genres_of_publication.md
Particularly for publications which have a more or less fixed layout, database publishing opens up new ways of designing books. For example in the case of a collection of essays, a catalogue, or a journal, readers can compile a personal selection from the available texts. A structured presentation of all material is made possible based on the metadata, allowing readers to navigate and put together a collection based on their own personal interests. Of course this means that **tagging**, describing, and storing all the components must be done in the early stages of publication and with utmost care. 


   TERM: Text editor
06_guide_DIY.md
Most of the elements of an EPUB can be manually typed in a **text editor**. Text editors are used for editing plain-text files such as HTML files, and should not to be confused with word processors such as Microsoft Word or Apple's Pages (though it is of course entirely possible to create and edit text plain-files using a word processor). Popular text editors include BBEdit, TextWrangler or TextMate for Mac, or NotePad++ and PSPad for Windows. The following is a step-by-step description of the process of creating a very simple EPUB.

02_the_basics.md
One of the most widespread forms of electronic publishing consists of scanning existing paper books and converting them into digital media such as images, electronic texts, or an ebook. **Optical character recognition (OCR)** is often used to convert the printed text of a book into a digital text format such as **ASCII** or **Unicode**. After this conversion the text can be re-formatted, searched, or processed using other software applications. Examples of organizations or projects for book scanning on a large scale are: Project Gutenberg,[^Project-Gutenberg1] the Million Book Project,[^Million-Book-Project] Google Books,[^Google-Books] and the Open Content Alliance.[^Open-Content-Alliance]

'Going electronic' - or going hybrid - requires changing the way you work during the publishing process, from delivered manuscript to final publication. The software tools currently in use, from **word processors** such as Microsoft Word to **desktop publishing** suites such as Adobe InDesign, were created for the world of analog print and desktop publishing. Although it is entirely possible to create electronic publications from Microsoft Word documents [![Bloglink](images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/03/28/converting-a-docx-directly-to-epub-using-calibre/ "Link to blog post: Converting a Docx directly to EPUB using Calibre")(*Converting a Docx directly to EPUB using Calibre*) or InDesign documents [![Bloglink](images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/05/21/epub-development-in-adobe-indesign-cs6/ "Link to blog post: NOTES ON EPUB DEVELOPMENT IN ADOBE INDESIGN CS6")(*Notes on EPUB Development in Adobe InDesign CS6*), which are likely to be the standard format used in existing publishing workflows, in most cases this will be a painful, slow, inefficient and expensive process. This Toolkit focuses instead on do-it-yourself (DIY) technical alternatives. Firstly because the Toolkit is primarily aimed at publishers who, in most cases, cannot afford to outsource ebook design to external service providers; secondly because it is aimed at those who wish to keep the design process in their own hands.

The history of the modern ebook can be traced back to the late 1990s with the establishment of the Open eBook Forum, which defined a standard known as the Open eBook Publication Structure (OEBPS). This standard eventually resulted in the widely used ebook format known as EPUB, which is currently at version 3. Microsoft was heavily involved in the development of the Open eBook specification, based partly on technology developed by a company called SoftBook Press.[^businessweek-ebooks] SoftBook Press originally developed the format, based on XML and **XHTML**, as a companion to their hardware product, which was one of the earliest dedicated e-reader devices. The Open eBook specification was first released in 1999, and later renamed EPUB for the second version release. By this time the Open eBook Forum had become the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).[^interoperability-of-ebook-formats] The new EPUB2 standard supported extended features such as basic styling, customized fonts, etc.[^epub2-specification]

Having said that, there are exceptions. Workflow changes can be also minor for publishers who already do all their editorial work in highly structured digital document formats such as **XML** or databases; but this is typically only the case in scientific and technology-oriented publishing. Changes may also be minor for larger publishers who can afford outsourcing. Generating an electronic (digital) publication in parallel to a printed publication is then simply a matter of paying an external service provider, such as a document engineering company or a media design agency, to turn a Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign **file** into an ebook. This process can be quick if the book is visually simple - such as a novel or a textbook with few illustrations - and economically worthwhile if many ebooks will be sold.
