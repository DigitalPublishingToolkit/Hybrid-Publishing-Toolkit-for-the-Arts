###Footnotes and referencing- All references should be auto-inserted footnotes (in other words, no in text references that use parentheses/brackets). For example, not: Off the Press discusses the question of digital publishing (Lorusso, 2013). But: Off the Press discusses the question of digital publishing.  - Always put a period at the end of a footnote, even if it just a URL (make sure the URL still works).- Footnote numbers comes after comma/period; this is also the case if the comma/period follows a quotation mark. I.e.: ‘an alternative network’. - In the footnotes and in the reference list full URLs should be clickable - Dates in footnotes should be 19 November 2010 (not November 19, 2010). - For specific formatting of footnotes and reference list, see further on in this style guide.


###Footnote and End References:Text references in footnotes and in the list of works cited (bibliography, aka Reference List) should follow the same formatting. Footnote references should adopt the following formats:  ####Footnote Referencing: *Anonymous/unknown authors*Largely found in news outlets (print and online) as well as blogs etc. If no author given, the citation should begin with the name of the article in single brackets. BooksDavid Harvey, A Brief History of Neoliberalism, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. Antonio Negri, Insurgencies: Constituent Power and the Modern State, trans.

###Quotation
- For quotations longer than four lines use blockquote. Don’t use quotation marks around a block quote. When needed, use double quotations marks inside a block quote. - Commas and full stops should be placed after the quotation mark, if they’re not part of the quotation.- All quotations should use single quotation marks except in instances of a quote inside a quote (in such cases use double quotation marks inside single quotation marks).- If ellipsis are used in a quotation because the article’s author has removed or altered text, for example for the sentence to read grammatically correctly, be sure to put square brackets […] or [has] around the ellipsis to indicate this notation is made by the author.


###Word Choice- Use American spelling:* favor, color, honor, theater, center vs. favour, colour, honour, theatre, centre,* use  ‘-ize’ instead of ‘-ise’ For instance, organize, categorize, standardize, authorize, etc.- Although the publication uses American English, if quotes use British or other spellings, leave as is in the original quote – do not change to U.S. English.- internet, not Internet
- folder, not directory- web not Web (but World Wide Web should be capitalized, and Web 2.0)- 18th not eighteenth century- 90s not nineties
- open the '.docx file', not open the 'docx file’

### Images
If images are figures ALWAYS leave 1 empty line before and another after the image syntax,even if it is a comment. 
Example:

...text... .. blahh blahh.

![myfigure](images/myfigure.png)

The text goes on...

#### Image path
The images' path is now only `images/`


#### Bloglink Images
In oder to create links to blog, using the blog icon, use the following syntax (in upper-case is what must be filled in by you: URL to blog and the name of the post):

[![Bloglink](images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)]( URL TO BLOG POST  "Link to blog post: POST NAME") 


Example:

Although it's possible to create electronic publications from Microsoft Word [![Bloglink](images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png)](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/03/28/converting-a-docx-directly-to-epub-using-calibre/ "Link to blog post: Converting a docx directly to epub using Calibre") ... and text continues...


###Others
We shouldn’t feel obliged to name every operating system option available, but instead give an informed choice. For example in the case of Markdown editors en distribution platforms.
