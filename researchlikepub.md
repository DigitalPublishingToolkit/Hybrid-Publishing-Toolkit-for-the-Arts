### General questions

Should it be a 1:1 transfer from paper book to e-book?
This is the traditional view.  
The book is a unique, one off publication.  
A lot of different people working on separate parts of the project, but all towards one single goal: the end product, mostly print, sometimes translated 1:1 to an e-book.

With text oriented files this may seem the most straightforward, maybe even the only useful way. There is not more than text, perhaps accompanied by a couple of images. Most important is e.g. to get references right, and a nice advantage is that making an index will be much easier digitally.

What are alternatives?  
What is possible when using a hybrid workflow, focused as much on e-publications as on print? (Next to having digital publications running naturally from the workflow, instead of having to be forced out of the print oriented workflow, of course)  
* Version control can be more transparant   
* Adding elements other than text (videos, (color) images, links)  
* Extracting outputs from the material different from the book itself, such as abstract, booktrailers, personalized ePubs
