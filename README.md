# From Print to Ebooks: a Hybrid Publishing Toolkit for the Arts

A guide from print to e-books

Welcome to the working version of the (digital) publication for the [Digital Publishing Toolkit](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/) project.


## EPUB
Create a simple EPUB of the publication by running:

`make toolkit.epub`

Create a more elaborate (including hyperlinked glossary) EPUB by running:

`make FromPrintToEbooks.epub` (command requires python's [html5lib](FromPrintToEbooks.epub))
