# From Print to Ebooks: a Hybrid Publishing Toolkit for the Arts

A guide from print to e-books

Welcome to the working version of the (digital) publication for the [Digital Publishing Toolkit](http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/) project.


## EPUB
To create the simple EPUB of the publication run:
`make toolkit.epub`

To run a more elaborate (including hyperlinked glossary) EPUB of the publication run:
`make FromPrintToEbooks.epub`

(Last make command requires python's [html5lib](FromPrintToEbooks.epub))
