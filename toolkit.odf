<h1 id="introduction">01 Introduction</h1>
<p>'You must change your life' - borrowing from philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, this could be the summary of our message for art and design oriented publishers, writers, editors and designers who are transitioning from traditional book making to electronic publishing or - more typically - hybrid print and electronic publishing. Hybrid publishing will sooner or later confront them with the following: (a) rethinking of traditional publication formats, (b) rethinking of editorial and production workflows and (c) rethinking of distribution. The changes that need to be made might be greater and more extensive than initially expected!</p>
<p><em>Change is minor for scientific and mass publishers</em></p>
<p>With that said, there are exceptions. Workflow changes can be minor for publishers who already accomplish all their editorial work in highly structured digital document formats (such as XML or databases); but typically, this is only the case in scientific and technology-oriented publishing. Changes might also be minor for larger publishers that can afford outsourcing. Making an electronic (digital) publication next to a printed publication then is simply a matter of paying an external service provider such as a document engineering company or a media design bureau for turning a Microsoft Word or InDesign file into an <strong>ebook</strong>. This process can be quick if the book is visually simple - like a novel or a textbook with little illustrations - and economical if many ebooks will be sold.</p>
<p><em>Change is major for small, arts-oriented publishers</em></p>
<p>Since this Toolkit is for publishers who (a) publish visually oriented books in (b) mostly smaller print runs, it proposes an alternative route than the one mentioned before. Neither a complex internal IT infrastructure, nor costly outsourcing will be viable solutions for these types of publishers. But, to disappoint a common expectation, unfortunately there is no magic software button that will turn a print book design into an electronic publication just like that. Since the two media are so different, with their own specific editorial and visual design needs, such a button will probably not materialize in the future either. Hybrid publishing will ultimately require editorial work to change. The good news is that it can. this toolkit will provide a guide on how to deal with the several issues which arise when making the transition for traditional to hybrid or electronic publishing.</p>
<p>For art and design publishers, the challenge of going electronic with their publications is greater compared to other fields of publishing for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>visually oriented publications are still more difficult to realize technically in the electronic medium when designing for a multitude of different reading devices and ebook <strong>platforms</strong>;</li>
<li>small publishers are under high pressure to keep project costs low due to often smaller budgets - but having to publish in multiple forms (e.g. print and electronic) will increase costs unless one accomplishes as much work as possible in a way that is not the dependent on the medium;</li>
<li>To make the investment in a digital publication durable it is necessary that electronic publications are sustainable: they should not need constant investment into technical maintenance and version updates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="industry-promises-versus-reality">Industry promises versus reality</h2>
<p>We face a major contrast between computer industry promises and the reality of the new digital medium. On the one hand, publishers, editors, designers and artists tend to overestimate the interactive and <strong>multimedia</strong> possibilities of electronic publishing. These extra possibilities do exist, but in most cases cause higher development costs and remain specific to one particular technical reading platform.</p>
<p>On the other hand, publishers tend to underestimate how even technically simple and seemingly banal types of electronic publications can lead us to rethink established publishing practices and formats. When traditional publishing formats go electronic or hybrid, the possibility for transformation is real. Once the book becomes electronic or hybrid, the permanence, immutability and stability typical of physical books, is likely to mutate into dynamic, modular, and participative forms, that can benefit from the networked environment where ebooks exist.</p>
<p>Different types of electronic publications can be subject to significant change. An exhibition catalog, can for instances be split up into interrelated micro-monographs that readers can download and read as individual ebooks. An ebook can be assembled from a variety of sources selected by the reader, as currently happens in Wikipedia, where the visitor can compile her own collection of Wikipedia articles and export them to an <strong>EPUB</strong> or PDF using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Books">Book creator tool</a>.</p>
<p>The possibilities for change can go beyond rethinking publishing formats and expand to redefine what the book is.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-toolkit-provides">What this Toolkit provides</h2>
<p>Going electronic - or going hybrid - means that you need to change the way you work in the publishing process from manuscript to publication. The software tools currently in use, from word processors like Microsoft Word to desktop publishing suites like InDesign, were created for the analog or desktop-publishing world. Although it's possible to create electronic publications from Microsoft Word <a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/03/28/converting-a-docx-directly-to-epub-using-calibre/" title="Link to blog post: Converting a DOCX directly to EPUB using Calibre"><img src="images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png" alt="Bloglink" /></a> and InDesign <a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/05/21/epub-development-in-adobe-indesign-cs6/" title="Link to blog post: NOTES ON EPUB DEVELOPMENT IN ADOBE INDESIGN CS6"><img src="images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png" alt="Bloglink" /></a> files that are likely the standard in the current publishing workflow, it will be painful, slow, inefficient and expensive in most cases. This Toolkit describes technical Do It Yourself (DIY) alternatives because it is primarily aimed at publishers who, in most cases, cannot afford to outsource ebook design to external service providers and furthermore it is aimed at those who want to keep the process in their own hands.</p>
<p>This Toolkit has a particular (but not exclusive) focus on EPUB3 as an electronic publication format and on Markdown as a word processing format because of the specific needs of small edition publishers in the art and design field: low cost, ease of use, sustainability and platform-independence. The recommendations stem from our practical experience in collaborating with four Dutch art, design and research publishers on electronic publication projects.</p>
<h2 id="whom-is-this-toolkit-written-for">Whom is this Toolkit written for</h2>
<p>You may be a publisher, a designer or someone who is just starting out with making books. You probably identify with or work in the arts. You may hope to gain answers, knowledge, get tips, and consult various resources. This Toolkit intends to provide them all. The overall focus is on pragmatic solutions for publishers within the art and cultural sector. No prior knowledge of creating an ebook is required ‚Äì with that said, a familiarity of various computer software is helpful, as is the willingness to learn and the inquisitive curiosity to look beyond this guide for certain answers. This publication is not a tutorial on how to make an electronic publication, it merely intends to give the reader guidance on how to make a first attempt at creating an electronic publication.</p>
<p>As mentioned before 'you must change your life', so there might a little culture shock reading through this document. If electronic publishing will merely remain an afterthought in the production chain and product portfolio, the change might be light. If electronic publishing will become just as important as print, the change may be radical. What this means is that if you want to make visual electronic publications, you should be willing to change your current way of working and gradually get used to the offered but less common alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-toolkit">How to use this Toolkit</h2>
<p>The Toolkit aims to provide a practical guide on how to develop electronic publications for publishers as well as for anyone else interested in this subject matter. It will attempt to give insight into the preconditions of electronic publishing, providing open-source tools where possible, and allow publishers of the art and culture sector to navigate the diverse and complex landscape of digital publishing in a more informed way. Furthermore, the Toolkit will help the reader to develop e-publications, specifically art and design publications, which generally make more use of different fonts, graphics and layout than text-dominant publications. Chapter 3 will give a general introduction of these publications and sketches out various scenarios on how to develop e-publications. Issues and opportunities of going electronic will be discussed, as well as strengths and limitations of particular reader hardwares and softwares, file formats and lastly distribution platforms. Chapters 4 offers a practical, how-to guide to workflows (both structured and per scenario) and designing electronic publications for the various scenarios addressed earlier in Chapter 3. Chapter 5 illustrates the concepts with concrete examples from the The Hybrid Publishing Toolkit For The Arts, A Guide From Print To Ebooks project.</p>
<h2 id="who-worked-on-this-toolkit">Who worked on this Toolkit</h2>
<p>This publication is part of the Digital Publishing Toolkit <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> RAAK-MKB <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> research project. The following research questions was stated: <em>'In what way can a platform be created with new tools for open source-publishing, by which publishers in the art- and cultural sector can produce interactive e-publications by themselves?'</em></p>
<p>To answer this research question, the Institute of Network Cultures (lectoraat Netwerkcultuur) of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and knowledge centre creating 010 of the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences executed state-of-the-art research. In collaboration with an already existing consortium [^DPT-consortium] of eleven MKB-companies consisting of publishers, designers and developers, a fivesome subprojects were formulated. Within these subgroups publishers, designers and developers, (research)lecturers and students of the participating applied universities collaborated.</p>
<p>The result is this publication and a toolkit that exists of tools for digital publishing, based on open source-software of which the source code is published and freely accessible<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. With a single command one can get hold of code repository, downloading not only the current state of 'source' files for the book, but also the full history of changes and comments were made by each collaborator to the toolkit up to that point. With another command, the various 'sources' are pulled together into an EPUB produced at that moment. In this way both the 'content' and the 'machine' to make the book are bundled and shared.</p>
<p>We are not claiming that all ebooks will follow, or must follow this path. We are simply laying out one of the many directions ebook creators can already undertake with their publications, by using with simple and inexpensive tools, and without needing to get into the industry's glossy scenarios of multimedia and interactivity.</p>
<p>Next to this publication and the toolkit, five e-publications of titles of the art- and culture books fund of the participating publishers were produced and presented on a platform that is developed for that purpose.</p>
<h1 id="the-basics">02 The Basics</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-text">What is a text?</h2>
<p>A text is a collection of words and words are compositions of letters. In order to read a text we have all kinds of layout helpers. Keep in mind that in the Roman times (when texts were cut in stone) there was continuing writing: no spaces between the words. This was not considered a problem as reading was a craft only a few people mastered. These people knew the words and hence were able to read aloud, just try: <em>Icanreadthiseasilyaloud</em>.</p>
<p>In time, the craft of reading became a common good and many design/lay-out helpers were introduced, for example spaces between words, capitals at the beginning of new sentences, commas, semicolons, colons and line breaks.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Furthermore, the notions of paragraphs, chapters and the like, developed into a standardized system that allowed for a smooth transmission between the structure the authors endowed their text with and the readers who became familiar to these standards. Thus enabling ease of reading and the possibility to read silently.</p>
<p>This structure of stratifying words into sentences, sentences into paragraphs and so on, including reading aids such as exclamation marks, bold and underscored text is made possible by the insertion of special codes. This process is called <strong>markup</strong> and the codes are called mark-up elements. It goes without saying that all these <strong>markup</strong> elements demand stable definitions and clear relationships. Everybody is free to invent their own rules (e.g., every first letter of a new chapter is a well-decorated small picture). For example, in the time of handwritten manuscripts many ‚Äúfree style‚Äù inventions were made. Some of them remained in our time and became part of the expended alphabet. Think of the ampersand ‚Äú&amp;‚Äù, it originated from the conflation of the letter e and the letter t ‚Äì we call this conflations, <em>ligatures</em>. To define what we allow and what not, <strong>Markup languages</strong> emerged.</p>
<p>Markup languages are grammars that define the markup and the relations between markup elements. With the emergence of computer networks and the increasing need to standardize texts for multiple usages, an international ISO standard established in 1982 is called: Standardised General Markup Language (SGML). This logically structured markup language was a big step forward as it made a fundamental split between the text structure as such and the final representation of that structure. For example, contrary to languages used in word processors such as Tex, <strong>LaTeX</strong>, Word, Microsoft Word, Wordperfect or ODF (open office document format), where presentation and text structuring are mixed, SGML only defines functions or roles. When we type a <strong>bold</strong> word in the text using a word processor we in fact type ‚Äústart bold‚Äù -&gt; type the word -&gt; ‚Äúend bold‚Äù.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/03_4_boldstrong.png" />
</div>
<p>What is happening here is a mixture of <strong>layout</strong> and structure. Layout is the activity of presenting a text onto a medium, such as a paper page. SGML and its derivatives, the easier <strong>HTML</strong> (HyperText Markup Language) and the expanded <strong>XML</strong> (Extensible Markup Language) make a strict distinction between structure and representation. A markup language knows notions such as ‚Äúhighlighted word or phrase‚Äù and then type 1,2,3... This allows you to equate e.g.: chapter heading with type 1 and quotation with type 4. Depending on the output substrate you can then define in the layout phase how this will look like. For instance, a chapter heading is in a certain type font and font size and centered on the page, whilst a quotation is represented in the same font size and font of the running text, but now in italics. On a screen we can have things like chapter headings in pink and quotations in yellow.</p>
<p>This freedom in the layout is explicated in a so-called <strong>style sheet</strong> , which is a table that connects a layout schema with the markup schema. This way of working is imperative if one wants to allow a source text to be represented in many different ways on various media of various sizes. Note that in many programs these translations are done fairly invisibly to the user. If we translate an .odt file into a .docx file, all coding is translated one-to-one. As we will see in the following, translation between one file type into another is not always symmetrical. Hence, the golden rule is to <em>always make sure that the source text is as systemically structured as possible</em>.</p>
<p>An important notion is that all digital texts and accompanying coding are written in simple letters and numerals, this is called <strong>plain text</strong>, or a flat file. This is a stripped down text without layout; the most elementary token. It goes without saying that the flexibility of this process is limited to the character set for plain text we use. In the ‚Äúold‚Äù days this was <strong>ASCII</strong> based and limited to the possible number of distinct signs (letters, numerals, commas, etc.) of a binary computer text. Slowly but surely, a new elaborted list of allowed signs, extending ASCII is making inroads. This collection of signs is called: <strong>Unicode</strong>. Unicode aims to include all alphabets and letter systems including common signs and ligatures, such as the aforementioned <em>&amp;</em> and diacritic signs. Again, this is a step forward to guarantee a clean source file for all kind of usages, even those we don‚Äôt consider or even imaging today.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-an-electronic-text">What is an electronic text?</h3>
<p>An electronic text is normally understood as a text which is represented on a screen of some sort. Of course this is sloppy language. The key issue is that an electronic text became a structured file in which the emotions and intentions of the author are translated into notions like highlighted text of a certain type through the work of said author. Due to this markup, we become able to make different layouts, expressions, onto different media. It is of great importance to note that electronic publishing introduces a big shift away from the page centered culture of book printing. Book printing allows for various printing sizes depending on the wishes of the author, designer and publisher. For example, when making an art book based on a collection of paintings or drawings, a decision can me made on what the ideal book size is and whether or not it will be printed in oblong size or not. In the world of screens these types of decisions are different as we have very different screen sizes. No screen can be cut to the demanded size like with paper book publishing.</p>
<p>In electronic books we have to work around things in a completely different way to the paper world. This means that the transposition from an existing work to an electronic representation is rife with difficulties if the structure of the texts and, in particular when the relation between illustrations and running text, is important. In the world of text based publications (novels, research publications) there is generally only running text. For these publications the page size is less important and this is part of the reason why ereaders are becoming increasingly popular. On electronic reading devices the text can always be made to fit the size of the device, this is called <strong>reflowable</strong> text. In all other cases, the creator (publisher, designer, etc.) has to consider how to design the work and under what conditions content and meaning are represented. This will be discussed in the following chapters for various outlets, as one might opt for various versions of the original work. It goes without saying that in the coming years, authors and designers will try and develop digitally conceived works that intrinsically allow for a variety of representations depending on the reading device whether electronic or not.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-electronic-possibilities">What are some electronic possibilities?</h2>
<p>Novel electronic capabilities enable a great number of possible publication outlets. Before entering into the problematic aspects of such a plurality of presentations of the same message, we investigate the possibilities. As with all technological possibilities; the coin has two sides (leaving aside the unstable rim) which exclude each other. The printing press introduced pagination and indexing, allowing many thousands of identical texts to be read and compared by an expanding group of readers over the years, independently of location. In an electronic world with non-fixed screen sizes this is complicated. On paper text is fixed, this allows for comparisons and interactions between different readers separated in space and time. In an electronic version the fixity of the text remains, as the text file is independent from its final substrate (<strong>e-ink</strong>, <strong>LCD</strong>, paper), but its presentation on the final substrate can vary substantially. Think about the introduction of numbering phrases in the Bible, which came along when Bibles became printed books in very different formats and the priest wanted everybody in the audience to read the same text. As the formats of the Bibles were non standardized, page numbers were of no help, hence the numbering of the phrases. In an electronic environment, where page numbers are unstable, we are confronted with the same problem.</p>
<p>The challenge becomes even greater if we widen our ambition to pictures, audio and video, hyperlinks, etc. In the Toolkit project, we deal with the field of books in the arts. This category of books integrates all aspects of text-only publications but expands it with visual information that can be explanatory of the text and, more importantly, to visual information which can be a 'stand alone' statement. In such cases, text, helps the 'reader' (viewer) to have an understanding of and have a deeper appreciation for the object. It is clear that various forms of art books demand and enable different electronic representations. In these books we witness a crossover between the primary importance of text and image.</p>
<p>As cultural standardization over the centuries rendered, for example, a detective, religious or an educational book instantly distinguishable by its typography and layout, - this too will also become a fact for electronic books. Apart from the electronic (or paper) book as a <em>object d'art</em>, electronic art book publishing will have many commonalities as a genre despite its differences per book. A major issue is that the electronic sub-structure makes all files just bitstreams (streams of binary code: zeros and ones). The digital files containing the various kinds of information are all equal on this level of digital bitstreams in the computer memory: merely standardized code. The great new thing in the world of electronic art books is that based on standardized, though well tailored structures, the creative message can be published in a great variety of ways. This not only depends on the capabilities of the output (reading/viewing/listening) device, but also on the function of the book for the author in an actual context, such as a dictionary, a study, a reference, a coffee table book, or a leisure book. The same source can and will be represented differently under different circumstances. All these vistas demand a thorough and more labour-intensive editorial and production strategy. Not only because the same source can express itself in various output forms but even more so because once properly edited and stored electronically, information and its constituting parts can be reused and used in different ways, to be decided upon given a specific environment of goal, now and in the future.</p>
<h2 id="summing-up">Summing up</h2>
<p>The essential issue is henceforward that the start is a clean plain text file. Withing this text markup coding is added. This coding has to adhere to standardized rules. In the most advanced case this would be according to the XML standard, but this very demanding grammar is too demanding for small publishers. Simple HTML coding is frequently used but is mainly useful for webdesign. The advanced version HTML5 is a promising, but also not simple option. In this booklet we opt for Markdown as a coding language as it is very simple and straightforward, however it is unfit for elaborate publications. From Markdown we can then convert to a HTML version, provided that we have a clear table that translate lay-out coding to the various outlets, such as paper, e-ink or LCD screens. Such a table is named a Style Sheet.</p>
<h1 id="genres-of-publication">03 Genres of Publication</h1>
<h2 id="five-genres">Five genres</h2>
<p>In the present project we deal with various kinds of products which we combine into five genres:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Research publication;</p></li>
<li><p>Art/design catalogue;</p></li>
<li><p>Artist/designer book;</p></li>
<li><p>Art/design periodical;</p></li>
<li><p>New genres of publication.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="research-publication">1) Research publication</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heavy in use of text;</li>
<li>Texts take a central role;</li>
<li>Visuals are secondary (images refer to texts);</li>
<li>Often longer texts;</li>
<li>Often with a standardised structure;</li>
<li>Often with complex referencing (footnotes, endnotes, cross-references, citations, bibliographies, keyword and name indexes, list of illustrations, glossaries, table of contents).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Going electronic: Advantages and issues</strong><br />Advantages of going electronic with publications presenting research are first of all obvious for users: firstly, an ebook allows for copying (and pasting) text in an easy and natural way which has been long desired by researchers, students, and readers alike. Secondly, an obvious but crucial advantage is the possibility of searching within a text. Thirdly, a possible advantage is the posibility of embedding the <strong>datasets</strong> employed in the publication itself. For publishers a huge advantage has to do with the wider reach and availability of the content. Making the text available digitally will increase its spreading, not in the least regarding international outreach, as the ebook offers no limitations on availability. Open access publishing further changes the question of availability dramatically.</p>
<p>Issues which specifically relate to digital research publications lie in referencing. With fixed page numbers no longer there, there is no standard way to specify the location of the reference. Worth extra thoughts are setting the parameters for the use of and interaction between text and images within a publication.</p>
<p>Going electronic also opens up new possibilities for creating content. Due to the high level of standardised structure, a 'modularization' becomes possible, thereby allowing to go beyond the traditional way of essay writing. In particular when authors refer to each other, they often share data, quotations, tables, figures, et cetera. Multiple use and reuse of 'modules' will enormously enhance the communication within a community. However, this remains a future dream for now as comments and annotations don't stick with (a specific place in) the book like in physical books, which makes sharing difficult.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>(http://elpub.scix.net/cgi-bin/works/Show?234_elpub2008)</p>
<h3 id="artdesign-catalogue">2) Art/design catalogue</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heavy in use of images;</li>
<li>Visuals take central role over texts;</li>
<li>Visuals are primary (text refers to visuals);</li>
<li>Descriptive texts of changing lengths.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Going electronic: Advantages and issues</strong><br />Most art/design catalogues are image-heavy publications, and this is precisely the greatest challenge for electronic publishing in this genre. Being an art/design catalogue, it is important that the quality of the images is high, with no degradation of colours and the highest possible <strong>resolution</strong>. This means that a publication containing a lot of these images will be very large in size, posing a problem when it comes to downloading speed, storage space on the user's device and on the publishers servers. This is an issue that begs consideration but as speed and storage space increase exponentially over time, possibilities grow parallel.</p>
<p>Possibilities in this direction lie in offering high quality images which can be zoomed in to and complementing the content with other (interactive) materials. Also, most tablet computers offer much more better color reproduction (gamut) than the print page. An issue of concern is that in a catalogue often a fixed page layout is necessary: image and text must appear in a certain layout as they belong to each other. However, changes in size (of the device or of the settings a reader uses) might influence the flow of content, resulting in a drifting apart of pictures and text.</p>
<p>Just as with research publications, modularization offers interesting chances for writing and presenting material. As a catalogue is often built up around parts which are already modular in nature, there is a lot to be gained from using these features in electronic publishing. For example giving readers the opportunity to 'build' their own publication; publishing different editions (small, medium, large) of a catalogue without extra effort; easy updating of a part of the catalogue.</p>
<h3 id="artistdesigner-book">3) Artist/designer book</h3>
<ul>
<li>Book <em>by</em> an artist, rather than <em>about</em> an artist;</li>
<li>Complex use of images and typography, often pushing the possibilities of the medium;</li>
<li>In print: making use of the book as a material, visual and haptic object;</li>
<li>Difficult or impossible translation into other media;</li>
<li>Text is often used in non-descriptive or non-narrative ways.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Going electronic: Advantages and issues</strong><br />As artists/designers books essentially represent a reflection around the medium itself, it is not a question of going electronic and considering the accompanying 'advantages and issues'. There aren't advantages or disadvantages in choosing a digital format or a print edition, it's a different choice that determines the artist book from the start. Also, choosing an electronic format like EPUB for an artist/designer book means to master the specificities of such formats. This seems to be one of the reason why there are few digital artists' books, except for electronic reproductions of artists' paper books on such websites as Ubu Web and Monoskop.</p>
<p>When working on an electronic edition of an already existing print artist/designer book, the most important thing thus is the choice of the file format. The specifications of the format (and medium in general, as mentioned above) determine the end result extensively. Furthermore, here too, the quality of images and the relation between text and images is important. Where an artists' book is not primarily a reflection of its medium, and electronic publication of a book or pamphlet is principally not difficult (a good example would be Sol LeWitt's 1968 &quot;Sentences on Conceptual Art&quot;), advantages of digitalization are similar to those in other genres: the more elaborate possibilities offered in interactive material, outreach of the publication, reach of new audiences, and friendliness for reusing text and images.</p>
<h3 id="artdesign-periodical">4) Art/design periodical</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heavy in use of both texts and images;</li>
<li>Both images and texts take central role;</li>
<li>Use of images is both primary and secondary;</li>
<li>Texts of changing lengths;</li>
<li>A more-or-less fixed page-layout format;</li>
<li>Recurring publication format (e.g. magazines, series etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Going electronic: Advantages and issues</strong><br />A periodical thrives well by its physical presence. It can be tossed in a bag and just as easily be disposed of. In a digital form, the physical presence becomes limited in this sense. Of course the digital domain offers other forms of 'nudging' and ways to keep a periodical present for the reader, such as push messages on tablets and smart phones, email notifications, and sharing via social media, but this is not quite the same.</p>
<p>The archival aspect provides other chances and issues for digital art/design periodicals. New articles can refer to older ones and even integrate parts. The periodical as such becomes a repository and therefore a playground for new work.</p>
<p>Advantages are mostly the same as with the other genres listed: increased possibilities in extending content (interactivity, video etc.); decreasing distribution costs; outreach to a large audience; modularity. However, storage and download/update speed present a challenge, as already mentioned above.</p>
<h3 id="new-genres-of-publication">5) New genres of publication</h3>
<p>New genres of publication are likely to emerge out of the ongoing digitization of the publishing industry. They could even fall outside of what we would normally consider a 'book', like short pamphlets, poems, essays, sketches, or - in the world of digital media - apps, a series of tweets, a blog et cetera. Or similar to adventure games, we can imagine the use of an interactive approach where the reader is able to control the narrative or to build or customize the publication.</p>
<h2 id="three-levels-of-electronic-publishing">Three levels of electronic publishing</h2>
<p>Independently of the different genres listed above we can sketch a basic picture based on commonalities and diversions. The scope of epublishing starts with simple conversions from paper publications to electronic ones, moving towards full-scale electronic publications. When thinking of the different forms of publishing in this respect, the role of metadata and the use and application of metadata also comes into view. <a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/10/09/embedding-a-custom-set-of-metadata-based-on-dublin-core-into-a-multimarkdown-document/" title="Link to blog post: Embedding a Custom Set of Metadata Based on Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Into a MultiMarkdown Document"><img src="images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png" alt="Bloglink" /></a></p>
<p>A division into three levels can be made, which are described in further detail below <a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/09/25/from-print-to-what/" title="Link to blog post: From Print to What?"><img src="images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png" alt="Bloglink" /></a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>One-to-one; the book is considered a separate product where text-authors, illustrators, artist photographers, and designers work together to produce the book, which then is published and exists as a single edition. The print book can as such be translated one-on-one into an ebook.</p></li>
<li><p>One-to-many; the publication has various chameleonic appearances, dependent on the context and available presentation media (type &amp; size of screen/paper). In other words, a book is offered in formats such as print, EPUB, <strong>PDF</strong>, MOBI, web, and looks and works according to the format used.</p></li>
<li><p>One-to-database; here the book is not a separate, defined, and limited entity. A publication is put together out of various independent components defined as modules that can be used and re-used multiple times by whomever has access to them. For example: a reader chooses a selection of chapters on offer and gets an epub specially made in this occasion.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/04_1_three_levels.png" title="Three Levels of Electronic Publishing." alt="Three Levels of Electronic Publishing" /><p class="caption">Three Levels of Electronic Publishing</p>
</div>
<h3 id="one-to-one-publications">1) One-to-one publications</h3>
<p>On the first level, there is the unique book. Each book is considered as a separate product where authors, illustrators, artists, photographers, and designers work together to produce the book as a one-off team. The production workflow can be unique from book to book, but mostly is traditional, moving from manuscript to a designed PDF ready to be printed. Pictures and/or full layout pages do not work as reusable (digital) objects. In many cases no archives of the independent ingredients that together create the end-product are available.</p>
<p>Usually this implies that going electronic means making an erepresentation of the same book. In some cases files of the final pages or book are being converted into EPUB3 by an external agent. The final pages are checked on readability and the digital make-up (for example, that figures and captions are on the same page), and changes are made accordingly to create the ebook. On this level the ebook is not more than an exact-as-possible picture of the printed book.</p>
<p>The publisher might use a document management system, which can be a mere collection of folders/directories on a hard drive. Archiving files is important for possible reprints. Sometimes publishers are forced to scan their own books in order to reprint them because they don't have an archived version of it. Herein lie great possibilities, because having an archive of semantically structured content allows reissuing the publication in efficient ways and in new formats not envisioned before.</p>
<p>There are many common characteristics between books in one genre. The question is how we can reveal and define these characteristics to enhance insight in the nature of the genre at hand and thus enhance the realisation of these new options.</p>
<h3 id="one-to-many-publications">2) One-to-many publications</h3>
<p>The next level presents a split between the manifestation of a (one) paper print version and (many) electronic versions. The electronic version, contrary to the paper version, is not a single object but has various appearances, due to different presentation substrates of electronic book formats. Furthermore, the sizes of reading devices are not standardized and generally allow for both portrait or oblong viewing. On top of this, the popular semi-standard EPUB3 allows for flowable pages and a change in font and fontsize.</p>
<p>Workflow schemes become very important when working towards a one-to-many publication, as the same texts and images are used in various outlets. A structured and detailed workflow, accompanied by a related descriptors (metadata) set is necessary. In such a way, the ebook is not a byproduct of the print book anymore, but is produced simultaneously in its different output formats.</p>
<h3 id="one-to-database">3) One-to-database</h3>
<p>Database publishing presents the final level. Database publishing means that all objects or entities constituting a publication can be used independently and easily from each other. To that end they should be uniquely defined and stored in a database. As a precondition for full scale database publishing, the editorial workflow is important, because it is there that a decision is being made on what items are defined as individual entities and which characteristics and features (metadata) they have.</p>
<p>Especially in publications which have a more or less fixed layout database publishing opens new ways of conceiving books. For example, in the case of a collection of essays readers are then be able to make a personal choice from the available texts. The same can be thought of in the case of catalogues and journals. Based on metadata a structured presentation of all material is made possible, allowing the reader to navigate and put together a collection based on personal interests. Of course this means that tagging, describing, and storing of all components should happen in the early stages of publication with utmost care.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there will not be one workflow which fits all but if the relevant metadata is available publications in different forms can be created.</p>

<h2 id="reader-hardware">Reader hardware</h2>
<p>There are several ways to peruse electronic publications. Portable devices like ereaders or tablets are by far the most popular gateway to digital content. Smartphones also offer some of the capabilities of an ereader, as most of these devices are a miniature version of their tablet counterparts. Lastly not to forget the desktop computer, which is often used in combination with the physical book, especially in the case of research publications.</p>
<h3 id="ereaders">Ereaders</h3>
<p>Ereaders became widely known with the introduction of the Amazon Kindle in 2007. Ereaders differ from tablets in the way that they are only suitable for reading books, are relatively cheap and have <strong>monochrome</strong> displays. An important characteristic of the ereader is the use of <em>electronic paper</em> (epaper), a so-called electrophoretic screen. Electronic paper is designed to mimic the characteristics of paper as closely as possible and is relatively low in energy consumption. The current generation of epaper is incapable of rendering complex motion, so animations and videos are impossible to use.</p>
<p>Both Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble also offer more expensive models, Amazon Fire (and Fire HD) and NOOK Tablet (and NOOK HD+) respectively. These models are not really ereaders anymore, but fully-fledged, small sized tablets. These models do not use epaper, but instead work with color LED screens with backlight ‚Äì a standard component of tablets such as <strong>iPad</strong> and Galaxy Tab. Often these tablets use a version of the Android operating system as its core, in contrast to the classic monochromatic ereaders using their own operating system built on a version of <strong>Linux</strong>. The Samsung Galaxy Note and Apple iPad mini can be seen as an answer to the smaller sized tablets.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of a color screen the current generation of ereaders is best suited for prevalently text publications, i.e. novels or research publications.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/05_2_strengths_limitations_04.png" title="Strengths &amp; Limitations." alt="Strengths &amp; Limitations" /><p class="caption">Strengths &amp; Limitations</p>
</div>
<h3 id="tablets">Tablets</h3>
<p>The tablet-market is dominated by two main players,<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Apple and Samsung. Apple utilizes their own operating system (<strong>iOS</strong>) for the iPad, while Samsung with its Galaxy Tab product line has opted for Android. The Android-segment of the market consists of many manufacturers offering similar hardware with a variant of Android as its operating system. Several ereader applications exist for both iOS and Android, the most important ones will be reviewed in the <a href="#reader-software">reader software</a> section.</p>
<p>Apple's and Samsung's most recent tablet screens cover nearly the entire so-called color space, which makes their color reproduction as good as that of professional <strong>monitors</strong> for photographers and graphic designers. It goes without saying that the color quality e.g. of a photograph, is still depended of the orginal capturing technque. Printing on paper remains a question of ink or toner and the printer technology used. Note that in arts publishing the combinaton of prining techniques and type of paper is very important for the end result. The human eye is different then an electronic screen. The upside of the tablet's color screen is at the same time also its weakness, as backlit LED screens are generally known to cause eye fatigue. Furthermore, reading in the sun is problematic, because direct sunlight obscures most of the visibility of the screen. Battery life is another issue with tablets. Although newer tablet models often claim impressive battery life, ereaders still reign supreme with an average battery life of up to several weeks.</p>
<h3 id="smartphones">Smartphones</h3>
<p>The story for tablets also largely applies to the realm of smartphones.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Of course most smartphones have smaller screens than both ereaders and tablets. But the similarities between smartphones and tablets are large enough to justify clustering them with tablet devices.</p>
<h3 id="pclaptops">PC/Laptops</h3>
<p>Reading ebooks on a laptop or personal computer is a possibility but may be a less natural fit than handheld devices. A full range of software for ereading is available, but the same downsides of relatively limited battery life and increased chances of eye fatigue exist as with tablets.</p>
<h2 id="reader-software">Reader software</h2>
<p>Standalone applications for desktops, tablets and smartphones offer some advantages to the software present on ereaders. Firstly, almost all devices offer a full color display, as opposed to the monochrome e-ink screens of ereaders. Secondly, a lot of applications support a larger subset of the EPUB standard, which allows for more features - like custom fonts, layout styling, etc.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/05_02_readersoftware.png" title="Strengths &amp; Limitations." alt="Strengths &amp; Limitations" /><p class="caption">Strengths &amp; Limitations</p>
</div>
<h3 id="mobile-applications">Mobile applications</h3>
<p>There are many existing applications for mobile devices (tablets and smartphones). Some of the available software constitutes of companion apps to well-known ereaders, like Amazon's <strong>Kindle</strong> and <strong>Kobo's</strong> range of reader hardware. The other category contains applications which are not for available ereaders but often offer their own storefront, viz. <strong>iBooks</strong> and Aldiko. EPUB 2 and 3 support is generally available, but some of the applications require the user to convert files into a proprietary file format in order for the ereader to be able to read the document. Kindle is an example, as it only supports Amazon's proprietary file formats (AZW, <strong>KF8</strong>, mobi) along with txt and PDF.</p>
<h4 id="ibooks">iBooks</h4>
<p>iBooks is Apple's ereader application for iPhone, iPad and Mac. Books may be bought in the iTunes Store or can be copied to the iBooks library. The latest version of iBooks offers support for many of the features of the EPUB3 standard, but also PDF and the closed-source <code>.ibooks</code> file format (IBA) - a derivative of EPUB3.</p>
<h4 id="marvin">Marvin</h4>
<p>Marvin is another application and one of the few paid entries. It does not offer its own store and is mainly geared towards managing existing collections of digital publications compiled from various sources. Marvin only accepts EPUBs and offers to convert incompatible file formats using third party software package such as <a href="#calibre">Calibre</a>.</p>
<h4 id="aldiko">Aldiko</h4>
<p>Aldiko is both a storefront and an ereader for Android which supports EPUB and PDF. As such it is comparable to Apple's iBooks. There is a paid version which offers some extra features (annotation, removal of advertisements) which the free version does not offer.</p>
<h4 id="kindle">Kindle</h4>
<p>Kindle is Amazon's tablet and smartphone counterpart to their physical ereaders (Kindle Paperwhite, etc.). The application is available for both iOS and Android. Books can be bought from inside the application on Android. On iOS it is less straightforward due to the restrictions Apple places on in-app purchasing. Kindle for mobile devices only has support for Amazon's proprietary file formats (AZW, KF8) and PDF. EPUBs have to be converted using software, for example Calibre, in order for Kindle to be able to import the files into its library. The application is able to sync its library so that a collection of ebooks is available on both the Kindle ereader and in the application. It is not possible to copy-paste.</p>
<h4 id="kobo">Kobo</h4>
<p>Kobo, like Amazon, produces ereader hardware and also has a large bookstore. As such the apps they offer for Android and iOS are largely complementary to the ereader companion devices manufactured by Kobo. Libraries are synced across devices, provided all the content is bought in Kobo's bookstore. Kobo supports both EPUB and PDF files.</p>
<h3 id="pc-software">PC software</h3>
<p>A plethora of desktop applications exists that allow users to read EPUBs. Of the five applications mentioned above only Aldiko is not available on desktops and iBooks is a Mac-only application. Kobo and Kindle both offer Windows and Mac versions of their software, Linux support isn't available - although Kobo offered beta software for Debian based systems.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The functionality is similar to that of the mobile versions.</p>
<h4 id="calibre">Calibre</h4>
<p>Calibre is an application of note here, because it's an ebook management suite with many features. It offers tools for managing large collections of ebooks, but also converts files to many different formats (both <a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and other text based formats).<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Viewing all major ebook file formats, as well as editing EPUBs and AZWs is also part of the software package.</p>
<h4 id="adobe-digital-editions">Adobe Digital Editions</h4>
<p>Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) is an ebook reader and management tool which is able to read EPUB and PDF. Support for EPUB3 is incomplete. Although Adobe claims support for all the important features is present, it doesn't elaborate on what those important features are. ADE also integrates with many ereaders offering syncing possibilities. So a library managed with ADE could in theory be synced with a compatible ereader.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="web-platforms">Web platforms</h3>
<p>There are some web platforms for reading EPUBs online, their popularity is hard to gauge. A project called Bookworm, developed by Threepress, was closed by O'Reilly Labs in 2012.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The reason given for the closure mentions an 'interesting experiment' but also due to the dramatic changes in the ebook ecosystem over the past few years. Booki.sh, another project, is still online and offers a complete library of ebooks which may be view and stored online.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It doesn't appear to operate commercially though, and the ability to purchase books was removed in June 2013.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="browser-applications">Browser applications</h3>
<p>Apart from web applications, several browser extensions exist allowing users to read EPUBs in their web browser. These extensions are most likely more of a convenience method in order to quickly (pre)view ebooks, instead of being fully-fledged solutions for reading ebooks comparable to the functionality of ereaders.</p>
<h4 id="readium">Readium</h4>
<p>Readium is a project by several publishers and technology companies aiming to provide a reference system, a collection of best practices, for rendering EPUB 3 publications.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The Readium Project offers a range of tools for online and offline use, mainly geared towards software developers. One of the tools is a browser extension <a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> for the Google Chrome Browser. After installing the extension offers an EPUB reader inside the browser window.</p>
<h4 id="epubreader">EpubReader</h4>
<p>epubReader is similar to the browser extension offered by Readium. However, the main difference is the supported browser, as epubReader is only compatible with Mozilla Firefox.</p>
<h2 id="file-formats">File formats</h2>
<p>A file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. Technically, it specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium. File formats may be either proprietary or free and may be either unpublished or open. A specific file format demands specific programs to read it.</p>
<p>In this chapter the history and characteristics of various important file formats that exist for ereaders, electronic devices capable of reading digital texts, will be explained. The development of the modern ebook started with the <em>Open eBook</em> specification and has thus culminated in an ebook format called EPUB which is currently at version 3 <a href="http://digitalpublishingtoolkit.org/2013/06/digital-publications-in-practice/" title="Link to blog post: An initial overview of the digital publishing landscape"><img src="images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png" alt="Bloglink" /></a>.</p>
<h3 id="reflowable-documents-epub-and-azw">Reflowable documents (EPUB and AZW)</h3>
<p>The history of the modern ebook can be traced back to the late 1990s with the establishment of the <em>Open eBook Forum</em> tasked with the creation of the <em>Open eBook Publication Structure</em> (OEBPS). Microsoft was heavily involved in the development of what became the <em>Open eBook</em> based partly on technology created by a company called SoftBook Press.<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> SoftBook Press developed the format, based on XML and XHTML, as a companion to their ereader. The <em>Open eBook</em> specification had its first release in 1999 and was later renamed to EPUB when the standard reached the 2 version milestone under the auspices of the <em>International Digital Publishing Forum</em> (IDPF, formerly the <em>Open eBook Forum</em>).<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The EPUB 2 standard has support for basic styling, custom fonts, etc.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>At the beginning of Amazon's foray into the world of digital publishing, the online bookseller chose not to use EPUB but opted to buy a French company responsible for the development of <strong>Mobipocket</strong> and the MOBI file format that also produced Mobipocket Reader software and an ebook reader for some personal digital assistants (<strong>PDA</strong>). One of the main reasons for this move was the widely supported <strong>Digital Rights Management (DRM)</strong> engineered by <em>Mobipocket</em>. The practice is controversial as it often hampers paying customers in freely interacting with digital goods'.<a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/05/29/the-book-as-directory/" title="Link to blog post: The Book as Directory"><img src="images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png" alt="Bloglink" /></a></p>
<p><a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Technically, the MOBI file-format is partly based on <em>PalmDOC</em>, an ebook file-format readable on PDAs running the Operating System (OS) developed by Palm Inc., with added support for the guidelines taken from the <em>Open eBook</em> standard.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Mobilepocket and Amazon then developed the format further in order for it to be used exclusively with <em>Mobipocket</em> and, later, Amazon <em>Kindle</em> ereaders. The MOBI format is now called AZW (probably an <em>acronym</em> for <em>Amazon Word</em>) by Amazon, their generic term for all ebooks released by the company.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Nowadays, roughly two generations of widely used ebook formats exist. One generation is based on the EPUB 2 standard as introduced in 2007, or an earlier version released under the <em>Open eBook</em> moniker. Amazon's MOBI/AZW is an example of this, as it's still widely used and supported by the <em>Kindle</em> ereaders. The other generally implements features from the EPUB 3 standard, while often remaining backwardly compatible with older versions and subsets of EPUB 2 and even 1 to a certain extent. EPUB 3, released in 2011, brought support for HTML 5, more advanced styling using <strong>CSS3</strong>, scripting (discouraged in EPUB 2) and easy embedding of video and audio, amongst others.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> EPUB 3 forms the basis of most of the ebook file formats available today. Most of the current file formats, like Amazon's AZW3/KF8 and Apple's iBooks, implement most of the EPUB standard, mainly to benefit from the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications, while adding their own proprietary extensions.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> These extensions are mainly geared towards extra support for more advanced (fixed) layout options, rich media integration and DRM.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> An AZW3/KF8 ebook is basically an EPUB 3 wrapped in Amazon's DRM. A MOBI version of the publication is also included to support older versions of eraders.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course EPUB 3 files without proprietary extensions exist as well and are sold to various commercial channels. In addition to their own iBooks file format, Apple also sells ebooks in their online store.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Other major players include Kobo, Google Play and Barnes &amp; Nobles' NookPress.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <a href="http://digitalpublishingtoolkit.org/2013/06/crash-test-dummy/" title="Link to blog post: Preliminary tests using a simple EPUB in order to establish support for various EPUB features."><img src="images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png" alt="BlogLink" /></a></p>

<p>Nowadays, roughly two generations of widely used ebook formats exist.

Amazon's MOBI/AZW is an example of this, as it's still widely used and supported by the <em>Kindle</em> ereaders. The other generally implements features from the EPUB 3.0 standard, while often remaining backwardly compatible with older versions and subsets of EPUB 2.0 and even 1.0 to a certain extent. EPUB 3.0, released in 2011, brought support for HTML 5 (as opposed to XHTML 1.1 in EPUB 2.0), more advanced styling using <strong>CSS3</strong>, scripting (discouraged in EPUB 2.0) and easy embedding of video and audio, amongst others.<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> EPUB 3.0 forms the basis of most of the ebook file formats available today.

<!-- Margreet: an overwhelming amount of terminology and formats introduced. Perhaps we should introduce some terms earlier in the toolkit? -->
<!--Amy: I agree with Margreet, there are a wave of new terms introduced over a very short piece of text. It is hard to get through it all without having previous knowledge or spending time in checking the glossary and references. So in conclusion i propose to link some terms to the glossary + reorder this chapter as mentioned in earlier note-->
<h3 id="other-formats">Other formats</h3>
<p>The aforementioned file formats may be categorized as <em>reflowable</em> documents as they can adapt its presentation to the output device. There are of course other ways different ways to disseminate electronic publications, for example the fixed layout, which preserves the look of the original, complete with fonts, colours, images, and formatting. One way of doing this is exporting a document as a <strong>PDF</strong> (Portable Document Format), but there are also more content specific file formats like the <em>Comic Book Archive</em>,<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> however support for these file formats by ereaders varies greatly.</p>
<h1 id="distribution-platforms">05 Distribution platforms</h1>
<h2 id="ebook-stores-amazon-apple-google-kobo-sony">Ebook stores: Amazon, Apple, Google, Kobo, Sony</h2>
<p>Many channels exist for distributing ebooks. Curiously, most traditional retailers (large bookshops, like Libris or AKO in the Netherlands) play a marginal role in the selling of electronic publications, with the exception of a company like Barnes &amp; Noble with their range of Nook devices and associated storefront. Large players in the field include Amazon, Apple, Google, Barnes &amp; Noble and Kobo.</p>
<p>The aforementioned storefronts typically charge a percentage for each publication sold, this percentage generally is no less than 30% of the retail price.<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Apart from Google, most of the larger retailers offer tight integration with their own branded ereader hardware (Kindle, iPad, Nook, etc.) For example, publications bought on a Kindle via the Amazon Store are immediately downloaded to the device for further use, without hooking the device up to a computer and transferring the purchases manually.</p>
<p>Each retailer accepts a different set of publications. Apple for example doesn't allow the sale of PDFs in its bookstore and only supports EPUB or publications made using iBooks Author.<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Amazon, via their Kindle Direct Publishing programme, supports a wider range of publications formats, including AZW, EPUB, PDF and even Microsoft Word documents.<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="online-reading-platforms-scribd-issuu-internet-archive-websiteblog">Online reading platforms: Scribd, Issuu, Internet Archive, website/blog</h2>
<p>Online reading platforms are browser-based platforms where digital publications are uploaded and made available. The publication can be presented in different formats. The choice for an online platform and the accompanying publication format also has effect on modes and reach of distribution.</p>
<p>When using an online reading platform, publishers effectively become dependent on the platform provider. If the platform changes its technology, terms of service or goes out of business, the publisher will be out of control. Online reading platforms typically create a higher degree of dependence and vendor-lock-in than classical ebookstores that distribute downloadable files (and where it is easier for a publisher to make those files on an alternative download/shop platform).</p>
<p>Below several platforms are discussed, including characteristics, statistics, strengths and weaknesses, and how-to-publish.</p>

<h3 id="social-reading-platforms">Social reading platforms</h3>
<p>Social reading has to do with the experience of reading ebooks. It is a field in great development, which lies beyond the scope of this Toolkit. However, it is good for publishers working on e-publications to keep an eye on the future of social reading.</p>
<p>Examples of social reading platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Goodreads</em> ('Goodreads is the world‚Äôs largest site for readers and book recommendations. Our mission is to help people find and share books they love. Goodreads launched in January 2007.')<br /></li>
<li><em>Social Book</em> ('Social Book, created by the Institute for the Future of the Book, is a social reading platform that allows reader to add their own commentary to texts, share these ideas with others, follow others‚Äô comments, and create communities of interactive reader/writers.')</li>
<li><em>Wattpad</em> ('Wattpad stories are free. Whether you‚Äôre online or off, use the devices you already own to carry an entire library wherever you go.' 'Join the conversation about the stories you read: message the writer and interact with other people who love the story as much as you.')</li>
<li><em>Hebban</em> (A Dutch social reading platform that released in beta version in 2014)<br /></li>
<li><em>Social media discussions</em> are also part of the social reading experience. One can think here of Twitter interviews or when a book is being discussed online by a publisher.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="print-on-demand">Print-on-demand</h2>

<h2 id="pirate-platforms-aaaaarg-monoskop-pirate-bay-library.ru">Pirate platforms: AAAAARG, Monoskop, Pirate Bay, library.ru</h2>
<p>As with music and films, 'pirate' platforms haven often been the avant-garde of electronic publishing. They provide music, films, games and electronic books as free downloads - either in outright copyright violation or in gray zones (when, for example, providing obscure and out-of-print books, films or recordings whose rights owners are unknown). Whether one likes it or not, pirate platforms have best met customer demand. Often, they are user friendlier than many Internet shops. The mere existence and popularity of pirate sites for digitized book shows, by the way, how large the market for electronic reading really is. Pirate platforms are, by their nature, even more volatile than online bookstores and ereading platforms. Worldwide, many organisations exist aiming to combat piracy and shut down facilitators of said practice, even when operating on a small scale. As a general rule pirate platforms have proven to be mostly resistant to the crackdown attempts by copyright enforcers, often reincarnating on a different web domain shortly after a forced closure.</p>
<p>Commercial providers of digital content can learn a lot from the pirates.Netflix,<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> the most successful web service for <strong>streaming</strong> films and growing competitor for pay tv, is known for buying films based on their popularity on The Pirate Bay.<a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="all-purpose-download-sites">All-purpose download sites</h4>
<p>Sites like The Pirate Bay offer all kinds of media for download: films, music, computer games and software, and electronic books. Since they are widely used, display current download statistics and since their technology (bittorrent) depend on user participation for their downloads to stay alive, they can provide great insight into what is really popular among readers.</p>
<p>The content listed on The Pirate Bay and other sites for the bittorrent <strong>protocol</strong> tends to be mainstream: Hollywood films, pop music, and a tendency towards non-fiction and technical handbook literature alongside fantasy and Science Fiction among the ebook downloads. For example, on a particular day and minute in June 2014, the book 'Atlas of Ancient Worlds' had more than 2000 downloads in 48 hours. In comparison, the most popular film - an episode of the TV series 'Game of Thrones' - had more than 70000 downloads.</p>
<h4 id="general-ebook-sites">General ebook sites</h4>
<p>The most simple pirate ebook sites offer any kind of book - very much like a large all-audience book store or Amazon.com's online bookstores. They are little more than a simple search engine that spits out downloadable ebooks. These types of sites have become particularly popular in Russia. At the time of this writing, library.ru has been the model for this kind of site and, after its crackdown, it was superseded by bookfi.org.<a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Also libgen.info,<a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> an online library, is an example to mention here.</p>
<p>What online booksellers could learn from these sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity combined with encyclopedic scope. With no other site except Amazon's, it is as easy to find and download an electronic book, no matter which genre, language, whether bestselling or obscure.</li>
<li>Simplicity in formats. The sites provide mostly PDFs as well as EPUBs, depending on whatever file format they have available (and obtained from hacker networks).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="specialized-sites">Specialized sites</h4>
<p>Some websites outside or in gray areas of copyright are artistic projects. In the 1990s, 'textz.com' by the Berlin-based artist Sebastian Luetgert was the first site to offer cultural, political and media theory books as simple, gratis-downloadable text files - among them, theory classics by Theodor W. Adorno. The name 'textz' was a pun on 'warez', a slang name for illegally copied software. Later, the web sites aaaaarg.org<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> and Monoskop<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> provided related collections of freely downloadable art, cultural and media studies books, yet with different thematic emphases: to stimulate reading and discussion groups, or to provide a carefully hand-selected library mirroring the taste of the site owner.

<p>Best known, and factually legendary, is Ubuweb,<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> an encyclopedic site providing downloadable sound, video and text file version of avant-garde arts records, films and books. Most of them fall under the category of small edition artists' books, and are provided with the artists' permission - since most these works never created revenue when they were commercially released.</p>
<p>All these sites run like small specialty bookstores (although they don't sell anything). They show that the opposite of Amazon and bookfi.org can work as well, namely the personal selection and combination of books. If they are as strong as in the case of Ubuweb and Monoskop, they create their own public that will download a work not because of having heard of it or of the author, but because being on such a particular site is recommendation enough.</p>
<h2 id="artist-designer-run-projects-badlands-kyur8-artists-ebooks">Artist-/designer-run projects: Badlands, KYUR8, artists ebooks</h2>
<p>In the last couple of years, there have been first attempts to create only small presses and book download stores for <a href="#artistdesigner-book">artists' and designer's books</a>: writer, artist and publisher, James Bridle (who coined the term 'new aesthetics') created the website 'artistsebooks.org' with freely downloadable EPUB files by experimental writers and artists. American contemporary artist and designer Paul Chan initiated the more commercial online press Badlands Unlimited that sells artist-made visual electronic books that are proprietary to the iPad and Apple's iBooks platform. The iPhone/iPad app 'KYUR8' (slang riff on 'curate') invites artists' to quickly make their own electronic visual zines using page templates and user's cell phone photo collections. Other examples are <a href="http://www.gauss-pdf.com" class="uri">http://www.gauss-pdf.com</a>, a publisher of digital and print works and <a href="http://trollthread.tumblr.com" class="uri">http://trollthread.tumblr.com</a>, a collective of poets that produces publications available for download in PDF or purchase as print on demand volumes.</p>
<p>None of these projects compete with classical ebook stores, online reading platforms or even specialist pirate sites. They are, after all, experimental projects and artists' portfolio pieces.</p>
<h1 id="towards-a-hybrid-workflow-based-on-markdown">06 Towards a Hybrid Workflow Based on Markdown</h1>
<p>Creating a workflow that is both structured and flexible enough to cater to different demands is a key step towards an efficient electronic or hybrid publishing strategy. The hybrid workflow we propose here is based on the need for publishing across different mediums, while keeping the majority of the work process in-house instead of outsourcing.</p>
<p>After describing a more traditional workflow based on desktop publishing via InDesign with a print book as end result, we move to an ideally fitted workflow centered around the structural file format XML, ending with a Markdown-oriented workflow which is both easy to use and extendable. Following such a workflow will make the transition from a print-centered publication process to a digital and print - in other words: hybrid - publication process viable.</p>
<p>Instead of developing a digital publication based on the printed book at the end of a production process, as is common practice by publishers, the regular workflow should be adjusted and made efficient and practical towards hybrid publishing at an earlier stage. From-scratch development of each publication format is thus replaced by single-source, multi-format publishing.</p>
<p>However, the description of the workflow which follows below starts at a point which in reality is not the beginning of the publishing trajectory, which starts in reality when an author hands in the definitive manuscript - so after the editing and rewriting process has passed through its final stages. Should the author already be working in Markdown, HTML or even XML format, this will change the workflow. However, in our experience manuscripts are mainly written in Microsoft Word and delivered in .doc or .docx.</p>
<p>Note: An important step preceding the publication trajectory lies in the formulation of the in-house style guide (see also <a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/10/21/style-guide-for-hybrid-publishing/" title="Link to blog post: Style Guide for Hybrid Publishing"><img src="images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png" alt="Bloglink" /></a>), where authors and editors can find the requirements for the manuscript. This style guide must be adapted according to the hybrid workflow before starting any work on the manuscript itself. For example: specification of the required file format, structuring of the text (headers, styles), image specifications, et cetera.

<h3 id="desktop-publishing-workflow-from-word-to-indesign-to-digital">Desktop publishing workflow (from Word to InDesign to digital)</h3>
<p>Desktop publishing represents the following for a lot of publishers: a Microsoft Word file is imported into InDesign and, after designing and editing, exported to PDF, ready to be printed. After work on the printed edition has been completed, the book is translated into an electronic version, following the design of the 'original' as close as possible. The aforementioned traditional, print-oriented workflow can be seen as a standard for one-to-one publications.</p>
<p>There are certain advantages to this workflow: it is simple, linear and there are no version branches. You end up with one consolidated manuscript, and What You See Is What You Get when it comes to design.</p>
<!-- Marc: I do not get the follow paragraph. Does it discuss the merits of the DPT workflow, or the difficulty of transferring a print design to a digital format?

For example, in the case of a print design where the page is fixed, changing hyphenation is a laborious process as hyphen indications need to be inserted manually in the InDesign document. However, in digital publishing, hyphenations are not fixed, but will be subject to change as they shift according to the aspect ratio and screen size of the device used. So when an editorial correction involves a hyphenation, this need not be adjusted in the digital file. However, this workflow of course also means a limitation in electronic design possibilities.  -->
<p>The main disadvantage of the DTP workflow is that you only target one medium and the steps to go from here to a digital edition are quite laborious, and do not make full use of the potential in electronic publishing. <!-- Marc: Maybe give an example of difficulties and limitations of this scenario? --> A workflow with the paper publication as its basis generally tries to translate print into the digital books, keeping the workflow one-dimensional instead of multi-dimensional.</p>
<p>Importantly, transferring an InDesign document to an electronic publication is not ideal, especially when working with older versions of the software <a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2013/05/21/epub-development-in-adobe-indesign-cs6/" title="Link to blog post: NOTES ON EPUB DEVELOPMENT IN ADOBE INDESIGN CS6"><img src="images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png" alt="Bloglink" /></a>. The results can be messy in terms of cleanliness of the code and may require extra steps in finalising the publication. <!-- Marc: The main question is: is cleanliness important. We developers might hate unclean code, but for most users this aspect is invisible. Does the unclean code actually hamper the rendering of EPUBs generated by InDesign  in various ereaders? Or is the code unclean to support as many ereaders as possible? --> InDesign, in its current state, is simply not optimised as a hybrid publishing tool, as it is (too) specifically developed for print design.[^EPUB Straight to the Point] The latest version of the InDesign suite (InDesign CC) is geared more towards electronic publishing, but requires very careful structuring and preparation of documents in order to yield good results within manageable work times. It's best suited for projects where the content is generated from databases, imported as XML into InDesign and from there exported to EPUB. For a detailed look at these developments, see also paragraph from InDesign to EPUB. <!-- Margreet: internal link needed--></p>
<p>It is possible to create 'interactive' publications in PDF, working with Microsoft Word and InDesign. In the end however these are also static InDesign documents, upgraded with some interactive layers. This is still a limited vision of what the possibilities are for digital publishing. The second workflow, which centers on the file format XML, does precisely that.</p>
<h3 id="from-microsoft-word-.docx-to-epub">From Microsoft Word (.docx) to EPUB</h3>
<p>Like InDesign, Microsoft Word and any other word processor or text editor that uses a similar approach (for instance Open Office) are not well suited for processing structured text. When working with structured text the author is expected to wrap elements (a heading to emphasise words) in tags, word processors generally apply a visual style to a text, without bothering with tags or any other form of structure. To a certain extent these text processing programs allow working in a structured manner, by using stylesheets which determine for instance different types of headers. The problem is that they do not separate between formatting and structure, while in the world of digital publishing this is especially important.</p>
<p>There is a viable solution for generating EPUB from Microsoft Word files, using the command line tool pandoc (for more information visit the <a href="http://www.johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/" title="pandoc website">Pandoc</a> [^Pandoc] website). The latest versions of pandoc (see below<!---insert cross-reference-->) support document conversion from '.doc' files generated by Microsoft Office 2007 or later, or by comparable programs like OpenOffice/LibreOffice. Since Word does not, as explained above, enforce good structure in a document, the EPUB generated by pandoc will never be perfect and ready for publishing. But it is still a clean enough, usable basis for a designer to produce a the final ebook. Other Word-to-EPUB programs, such as the built-in document converter of Calibre <a href="http://networkcultures.org/digitalpublishing/2014/03/28/converting-a-docx-directly-to-epub-using-calibre/" title="Link to blog post: Converting a DOCX directly to EPUB using Calibre"><img src="images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png" alt="Bloglink" /></a>, produce worse results.</p>
<p>In order to obtain the best possible EPUB file, the Word document should be formatted, solely if possible, with Word's standard paragraph styles such as 'Normal', 'Title', 'Subtitle', 'Quote' and most importantly 'Heading 1', 'Heading 2', 'Heading 3' for the headings according to their logical hierarchy. For example: 'Heading 1' for chapters, 'Heading 2' for sections, 'Heading 3' for subheadlines. The resulting EPUB document will contain a well-structured table of contents and document navigation menu based on the 'Heading' hierarchy, so well structured headings are of paramount importance. Word footnotes will be appear as linked endnotes in the EPUB, elegantly simplifying an otherwise tedious document redesign task.</p>
<p>Word unfortunately lacks two features that would make it more suitable for hybrid publishing projects: 1). Word does not have a 'strict mode' that would force all writers and editors of a document to only use defined paragraph styles instead of manually formatting. This means, your document will likely contain headlines that haven't been defined as headlines, but are just bold-faced text, quotes that haven't been defined as quotes etc. Unfortunately, if the manual formatting looks the same as the predefined paragraph styles, it is hard to impossible to spot these parts of a text. 2). Word provides no automatic or semi-automatic tools to find manual formatting and replace it with predefined paragraph styles. The only way to achieve this is to manually control and adjust the whole document.</p>
<p>Often, such inconsistencies in a Word document will only become visible after the EPUB conversion, for example as a missing chapter headline in the table of contents of the electronic book. These are the inherent risks and limitations of using Word in the editorial workflow. Nevertheless, the Word + pandoc solution will likely be the easiest and least painful solution for publishers to adopt.</p>
<p>We recommend two ways of working with Word + pandoc, and discourage a third one:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Direct conversion from Word to EPUB using pandoc. This will require that the Word document is 100% consolidated and no further editorial changes will be applied to it. A graphic designer can take the converted EPUB document and quite painlessly transform it into the final electronic publication (among others, by changing the typographic design to make it suitable for ereaders, by scaling and optimising images for screen reading, by adding bibliographic metadata etc.).</li>
<li>Conversion from Word to Markdown using pandoc. Since pandoc can also convert files <em>to</em> the Markdown format, this often preferable, especially for complex publishing projects. The resulting Markdown file can then be used as the master file for conversions into all kinds of other file formats (such as HTML for websites). Converting to Markdown yields the advantage that any formatting glitch that existed in the Word document becomes clearly visible. For example, a headline erroneously formatted as bold standard text will show up as '**headline**' while a properly formatted headline will show up as '#'. This makes it much easier to clean up the internal formatting of the document and have a clean master file for all subsequent document conversions. The EPUB file generated from this Markdown file would in most cases be better structured than the EPUB file directly generated from the Word file, and make the subsequent work of the designer easier. It is also possible to customise pandoc with conversion style templates. This even makes it possible to automatically generate complete and well-formatted EPUB files from the Markdown files without hiring a designer, depending on the type of publication.</li>
<li>Not advisable: Using pandoc to go back and forth between Word and EPUB. If the Word document is not consolidated, but subject to further editorial changes, conversion to EPUB (like in the first scenario) would have to be done again, and destroy all work of the designer on the previously exported EPUB file.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="markdown">Markdown</h3>
<p>Central in a hybrid publishing workflow, we recommend to use the mark-up language Markdown, as it is an easier language to use than XML. Markdown is not perfect, but is the most easy to work with and enables the creation of structured texts, thus allowing for hybrid publishing.</p>
<h4 id="introduction-advantages-and-limitations">Introduction: advantages and limitations</h4>
<p>John Gruber, developer of Markdown, describes Markdown on his website as follows: 'Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).'<a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Markdown is a way to process plain, unformatted text with human-readable formatting symbols. That means that Markdown doesn't use HTML style tags to format, such as <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> for bold or <code>&lt;author&gt;</code> to mark-up the author name. For example, this is what the beginning of <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> would like in Markdown:</p>
<pre><code># Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland

## Chapter I. Down the Rabbit-Hole

There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,

&gt; Oh dear! Oh dear! 
&gt; I shall be late!

(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she
ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
natural); but when the Rabbit actually **took a watch out of its
waistcoat-pocket**, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice
started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across
the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</code></pre>
<!-- Margreet: Would it be possible to also present the result in a visual, like if one is using Mou or Macdown? -->
<p>A short breakdown: '#' signifies a top-level headline, '##' a second-level headline, '_' italic text, ' ** ' bold text, '&gt;' a block quote. Beyond that, Markdown provides conventions for marking up bold text, lists, embedded images and links. Its popular extension <strong>MultiMarkdown</strong> also supports footnotes, tables, mathematical formulas, cross-references, bibliographies and definition lists. With simple open source converter programs, Markdown text like the above can be automatically translated into well-structured HTML, EPUB, PDF, RTF (for importing into InDesign) and other document formats, with a single mouse click or keyboard command, requiring no manual adjustments.</p>
<p>Markdown is a child of Internet culture. It standardises ad-hoc formatting signs used in e-mail and chats, and became popular in blogging software. There are similar plain text formatting languages to Markdown: the Wiki <strong>syntax</strong> used in Wikipedia, the language <em>Textile</em> that is used for a number of web content management systems and the language <em>reStructuredText</em> used for writing technical manuals, and many others.</p>
<p>Markdown and its siblings are human-readable, human-friendly well-structured document formats, excellent for long-term storage and as the basis (or source code) for conversions into present and future document formats. While they are simple, they are also both strict and unambiguous enough in their formatting syntax that multiple writers and editors can work on a single document without introducing strangeness into its formatting. Another advantage of Markdown can be written and edited in any computer program capable of processing basic text. Unlike the file formats of Microsoft Word or other classical word processing programs, the file containing the Markdown flavoured text is not bound to specific software, it can be opened using the simplest applications able to parse text.</p>
<p>Why do we recommend Markdown in particular? For particular publishing projects - for example, handbooks or books derived from Wikis, it can be worth considering one the alternatives to Markdown such as <em>reStructuredText</em>. There are, however, two reasons why we recommend Markdown as a practical tool for electronic and mixed media publishing:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Excellent software support. As the most popular human-readable plain text formatting language, there is a plethora of user-friendly, high quality software for writing and editing documents in Markdown and for converting it into other formats available. While Markdown can be written and edited in any computer program that allows to edit text, there are a number of very user-friendly text programs that make it easier to write and view, think of Mou, Macdown, Texts, MarkdownPad, UberWriter or MdCharm.</p></li>
<li><p>With Multimarkdown (an extension of Markdown), it provides all the necessary formatting and document syntax needed in arts- and humanities-oriented text publishing. It is perfectly possible to write, for example, a cultural studies Ph.D. thesis in Multimarkdown, or the essay part (complete with footnotes and bibliographical references) of an exhibition catalog.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Markdown/MultiMarkdown is not a magical one-size-fits-all solution, however. It is well suited for text-heavy editorial work, but limited when creating visual documents and not really usable for interactive publishing formats. It is also not a layout tool, but a pure manuscript format, excellent for keeping manuscripts in a well-structured, readable, durable, software-independent format.</p>
<p>Markdown and similar formatting/markup languages are meant for workflows in which there is a clear separation between editorial work - involving writers, translators and editors - on the one hand and publication design on the other. For publications requiring lots of interaction between writers/editors and visual designers/artists from the very beginning of the authoring process, these document languages are not the right tool.</p>
<h4 id="markdown-versus-xml">Markdown versus XML</h4>
<p>The most detailed structuring language developed is XML and it forms the foundation for many other languages. HTML (or XHTML), for example, is one XML-based document format, Microsoft Words' .docx is another.</p>
<p>XML is meant for structured documents that clearly separate logical structure from visual formatting. That doesn't mean it's actually used to that end, as mentioned before Microsoft Word isn't too strict when it comes to structuring, but .docx is still based on XML. Furthermore, as XML is in itself a toolkit (or actually: a syntax) for defining document formats, it's broad versatility also adds many layers of complexity. While XML theoretically presents the ideal way of working with single format files which deliver multiple output formats, we do not present it as the most advisable solution for small, independent publishing houses.</p>
<p>Markdown provides a good middle-of-the-road solution of a format that is easily usable for non-technicians yet much better structured, and a basis for easy document conversion into HTML, EPUB and many other formats, than Microsoft Word and similar classical word processing programs. Technically speaking, Markdown provides some of the same features and advantages, namely separation of content structure from visual layout, painless translation into multiple output formats as XML does. The relative simplicity and human readability comes, however, at the price of extensibility and universality. Markdown does not provide the flexibility of building one‚Äôs own extensions, but provide its own built-in, hard-wired syntax. In XML, there are standard methods of declaring and extending markup languages that can automatically be picked up by XML document converters.</p>

Open Source, runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Pandoc is the tool we recommend for working with Markdown, and has also been extensively used in creating this publication.</p>
<h5 id="a-note-on-limitations">A note on limitations</h5>
<p>A major downside of Markdown is that it exists in several variants, each with their own extensions of the basic Markdown syntax. In the context of this Toolkit, we recommend the widespread variant 'MultiMarkdown' that includes syntax for footnotes, tables, citations, cross-references, image captions and document meta data. It is also fully supported by pandoc, the recommended software tool.</p>
<p>Another downside is that Markdown allows some formatting to be marked up in different alternative ways (for example, underlines or asterisks for italic text) which can introduce inconsistency in a collaboratively edited document. The trick mentioned above, to use pandoc for converting from Markdown to Markdown, can be used to eliminate such inconsistencies in a master document.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing in late 2014, a controversial standardisation effort of Markdown and its extensions is underway, under the name 'CommonMark'. <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/">commonmark-controversy</a> [^commonmark-controversy] We will update this Toolkit as soon as CommonMark has been standardised, released, and is supported by the software we recommend.</p>
<h2 id="database-publishing">Database publishing</h2>
<p>What is gained by a shift to a hybrid publishing workflow? First of all, producing a publication with the possibility to have multiple output formats will be more efficient. However, when the workflow is put into use without restraint and when you really 'change your life', great possibilities will open up. The most important option is shortly discussed here, namely database publishing which uses a so-called content management system.</p>
<p>The ideal database is a collection of independent, but mutually related, objects. These objects can be everything from structured text to pictures of wildlife. The issue at stake is that we need clear grammatical and categorization systems that go beyond the immediate use of the database. Take as an example your mailing list. We can take the full address including the name of the person as one object. But if we want to select per zip code or any other sub category in a full address or want to add more information to the persons name, such as age, email address and previous purchases, we have to make a strict scheme with so-called fields and sub-fields, including their interdependences (a house number demands a street name and vice versa), their indispensability (age might be not crucial), and so on. What this means is that the holy grail of the all encompassing database is not only almost impossible but also an extremely time consuming operation to build and maintain.</p>
<p>The best option is therefore to explicate the goals of the publication programmme as well as the practical limitations. The four genres we discuss in this publication all have their own demands in relation to the creation and the dissemination of publications. An art catalog demands clear descriptors about the artist, the materials used, the sizes, the provenance, copyright, keywords according to established list, etc. Other collections of pictures might only need a subset.</p>
<p>Also in pure text databases we have to be careful. On the one hand we have obviously the data related to the author's name, affiliation, address, etc. But it becomes a different discussion if pictorial illustrations, graphs, etc. are shared between look-alike publications and for that reason we want to identify these objects individually. If such is the case, we might consider a special sector in our database that pertains to illustrations and their specific descriptive sub-field only. The same holds true for bibliographic references and the collection of hyperlinks used in the text.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we can only advise that various objects or in other words pictorial or textual entities are provided with as many consistent metadata (field descriptors) as possible.</p>

<h1 id="guide-how-to-make-a-simple-epub">07 Guide: How to make a simple EPUB</h1>
<p>Making an EPUB doesn't have to be complicated. As the EPUB standard is open and based on HTML (the same format as web pages), there's a large and growing variety of ways to convert and export to EPUB from different kinds of sources. For very simple publications, it may be possible to use a tool that directly converts your document to EPUB. The following options are being explained</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do it yourself EPUB from scratch</li>
<li>Do it yourself EPUB using InDesign</li>
<li>Do it yourself EPUB using pandoc</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="do-it-yourself-epub-from-scratch">Do it yourself EPUB from scratch</h2>
<p>The process of creating an EPUB from scratch is similar to developing a simple website. The main difference is that while websites can and often link to other websites, an EPUB is 'self-contained', any pages that are linked to, or images that are displayed must be part of the collection. Creating an EPUB by hand is useful for creating small personal publications, or for making publications that explore the particularities of the EPUB format in detail.</p>
<p>An EPUB is a zip archive typically named with the extension '.epub' instead of '.zip'. The EPUB is a compressed collection of HTML files, stylesheets, and images, like the files found on a website, compiled together with some extra files that mark and structure the files so that an ereader can display them. Any file archiver that works with zip files (Archive Utility, The Unarchiver, WinZip, etc.) can open and decompress an EPUB. In some cases, it might simply be done by renaming the '.epub' with '.zip'. Here is more information on how to automate the EPUB zipping process. <a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>You can download an example of a rudimentary EPUB that explains several of these ideas.<a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="layout-of-an-epub-package">Layout of an EPUB package</h3>
<p>Decompressing an EPUB will reveal its directory layout and in that way makes clear how an EPUB is set up. As explained above, the EPUB can be seen as a compressed zip archive. First unzip it using an archive program. After unzipping it, it looks as follows:</p>
<p><img src="images/08_1_epublayout.png" title="EPUB layout" alt="EPUB layout" /> <!--Kimmy: image is still in progress--></p>
<p>The <em>META-INF</em> and <em>OEBPS</em> directories and <em>mimetype</em> should always be present in an EPUB file and form a large part of what constitutes an EPUB:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>META-INF</em> contains an XML file (<em>container.xml</em>) which directs ereaders to an inventory (an .opf file) of all the files present in the publication.</p></li>
<li><p><em>OEBPS</em> is the location where all the content (HTML files, images, audio, video, etc.) of the publication is stored; (nested) subcategories are possible but not mandatory. The .opf file (traditionally named <em>content.opf</em>) is important; this contains the metadata for the EPUB and is in turn referenced by the aforementioned <em>container.xml</em>. You might see another file with a .ncx extension (traditionally <em>toc.ncx</em>), it holds the hierarchical table of contents for the EPUB and is entirely optional as it isn't part of the EPUB specification.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mimetype</em> is a file that contains a single line describing the EPUB file as <code>application/epub+zip</code>, this file allows ereaders to check whether the file is actually an EPUB and thus if they can read it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These three components form the basic structure of an EPUB and are required in order for the file to be a valid EPUB. For a formal specification of EPUB3, see the overview by IDPF.org which defines semantics and conformance requirements for EPUB publications.<a href="#fn73" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="creating-your-own-epub">Creating your own EPUB</h3>
<p>Most of the elements of an EPUB can be produced by hand in a text editor. Text editors are used for editing plain text files (for example HTML files) and should not to be confused with word processors like Microsoft Word or Apple's Pages. Popular text editors include BBEdit, TextWrangler or TextMate for Mac or NotePad++ and PSPad for Windows. Below follows a step by step process of creating a very simple EPUB.</p>
<h4 id="creating-the-required-files-and-directories">Creating the required files and directories</h4>
<p>Now that we've seen the insides of an EPUB after unzipping it, we can work the other way around and make the files and folders ourselves, thus creating a simple EPUB. We will work from our Documents directory where we can add folders like in the image above, and using a text editor to create the necessary files.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a directory under Documents to store the files and subdirectories for your EPUB, and name it <em>Example</em>;</li>
<li>Create two more directories inside the one you've just created, one called <em>META-INF</em> and the other <em>OEBPS</em>;</li>
<li>Using a text editor create a plain text file and add the line <code>application/epub+zip</code> to the file;</li>
<li>Save the plain text file, without a file extension, and name it <em>mimetype</em>. Put it alongside the two directories you created in step 2. In this way ereaders can see that this is an EPUB.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now there are the two directories and one text file, like we saw when we decompressed the EPUB used as an example.</p>
<h4 id="container.xml">container.xml</h4>
<p>Next we make the file 'container.xml', the XML file that directs ereaders to an inventory of all the files present in the publication, and that is located in <em>META-INF</em>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Again using a text editor, create a new file and save it to the <em>META-INF</em> directory with the name <em>container.xml</em>;</li>
<li><p>The <em>container.xml</em> contains a simple structure written in XML. Below is a complete version of the text, followed by an explanation of its separate parts. (You may ignore the explanation without much consequence if its too technical in nature.)</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt; 
&lt;container version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns=&quot;urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:container&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;rootfiles&gt;
        &lt;rootfile full-path=&quot;OEBPS/content.opf&quot; media-type=&quot;application/oebps-package+xml&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/rootfiles&gt;
&lt;/container&gt;</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>The first line is a <code>declaration statement</code> which should always be present in XML files. This is followed by the <code>container</code> which denotes that the publication is based on the <em>Open Container Format</em> as specified by the EPUB standard.<a href="#fn74" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The <code>rootfiles</code> tag denotes a collection of rootfiles, which is the possible starting point(s) for ereaders to begin processing and parsing the content. In this case the rootfiles contains only one entry, called <code>rootfile</code>, this tag has two attributes - <code>full-path</code> and <code>media-type</code>. The first attribute holds the path to an inventory file (in this case <em>content.opf</em>) containing metadata regarding the publication and its content. Finally, <code>media-type</code> is a reaffirmation of the EPUB's mimetype.</p>
<p>The important part of this document is the information in quotes following the attribute <code>full-path</code>: 'OEBPS/content.opf'. This attribute should point to an .opf file created in the next step.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Save and close <em>container.xml</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-opf-file">The OPF file</h4>
<p>The OPF file <!-- write out full description --> is an important part of the structure of an EPUB. It is located in the OEBPS directory and contains the necessary metadata to accurately describe the publication. Next to that it can contain the linear reading order which, in combination with the contents of toc.ncx, may be used by ereaders to build navigation menus or a table of contents. The OPF file is too long to be included verbatim in this document, but the most important sections are referenced below. The file 'Example.opf' in the rudimentary EPUB used here, is an example of a complete opf file.</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;metadata xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;
        xmlns:opf=&quot;http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf&quot;
        xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
        &lt;dc:title&gt;Example EPUB&lt;/dc:title&gt;
        &lt;dc:language&gt;en&lt;/dc:language&gt;
        &lt;dc:identifier id=&quot;BookId&quot;&gt;http://digitalpublishingtoolkit.org/ExampleEPUB.html&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;
        &lt;meta property=&quot;dcterms:modified&quot;&gt;2014-03-28T14:11:50Z&lt;/meta&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/metadata&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The metadata section describes the current publication. It lists information such as the title, author, publisher, etc. Most of these entries are identical to what librarians use to catalogue publications. Parts of the metadata section are used by ereaders to organize collections.</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;manifest&gt;
    &lt;item href=&quot;styles.css&quot; id=&quot;css1&quot; media-type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;item href=&quot;cover.png&quot; id=&quot;cover&quot; media-type=&quot;image/png&quot; properties=&quot;cover-image&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;item id=&quot;chapter1&quot; href=&quot;Cover.html&quot; media-type=&quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;item id=&quot;chapter2&quot; href=&quot;Page-01.html&quot; media-type=&quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;item properties=&quot;nav&quot; id=&quot;toc&quot; href=&quot;toc.html&quot; media-type=&quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;item href=&quot;toc.ncx&quot; id=&quot;ncx&quot; media-type=&quot;application/x-dtbncx+xml&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/manifest&gt;</code></pre>
<p>A manifest lists all the resources available in the EPUB package, with the exception of directories, the <em>mimetype</em> file, the contents of <em>META-INF</em> and the .opf file itself. A manifest file can be a pain to produce by hand for large EPUBs, as the list of resources utilised in the publication is bound to be long. Every resource has a unique <code>id</code> and should be referenced by a relative path in the <code>href</code> tag and described in the <code>media-type</code> attribute. The entry with the <em>cover.png</em> is of special interest, as the attribute <code>properties</code> describes the fact that the image may be used by ereaders as the cover image for the publication - e.g. for use in collection overviews.</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;spine toc=&quot;ncx&quot;&gt;
    &lt;itemref idref=&quot;chapter1&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;itemref idref=&quot;chapter2&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/spine&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, the <code>spine</code> lists all the pages present in the publication and it's listing arrangement tells an ereader the linear reading order of the publication. The <code>spine</code> can only contain (X)HTML pages, not images or other content. The <code>toc</code> attribute refers to the <code>id</code> of the <code>toc.ncx</code> in the manifest.</p>
<h4 id="the-content">The content</h4>
<p>As stated in the introduction of this section a large part of an EPUB is a collection of HTML files which are often interlinked. The process of creating the pages of an EPUB is similar to building a website, but with the particular limitations of ereaders in mind - limited support for rich media, colour, etc. An overview of the limitations can [be found here] <!-- internal link needed to limitations -->. Pages should be written in XHTML, a variant of HTML which was created to make HTML more extensible and increase the interoperability with other data formats. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) may freely be used, though a lot of ereaders ignore or do not parse many of the style definitions.</p>
<h4 id="packaging">Packaging</h4>
<p>Creating an EPUB file is as simple as selecting both the <em>META-INF</em> and <em>OEBPS</em> directories and the <em>mimetype</em> file and creating a ZIP archive. This may be done by using the built-in archive utility of the operating system, or an external program like The Unarchiver (Mac), WinZip (Windows) or a special purpose utility.[^EPUB zipping process] The .zip extension of the archive may then be renamed to .epub.</p>
<p>Because some archive programs create unnecessary (hidden) files inside the archive which might invalidate your EPUB, it's important to validate your EPUB to see if it works (although most ereaders will safely ignore extraneous files and parse the document properly). Invalid EPUBs are files that do not conform to the EPUB specification or have other issues, such as incorrect. Fixing validation errors will minimize but not eliminate the chance of ereaders refusing to read an EPUB. Validation of the EPUB can be done online using the EPUB Validator[^epub-Validator] or a desktop application.</p>
<p>And again your EPUB is ready!</p>
<h2 id="do-it-yourself-epub-using-indesign">Do it yourself EPUB using InDesign</h2>
<p>InDesign is an excellent tool for creating and managing print projects. It also has a powerful EPUB production tool that has continuously improved over time. Its omnipresence and importance in print make it an obvious choice for projects that have both a print and electronic output. It is so powerful that it's useful even if print isn't part of the equation‚Äîthough cost considerations might preclude its use if print is never a requirement.</p>
<p>InDesign can generate both flowing and fixed layout EPUB files. Flowing EPUB is characterized by text and images than can adapt to fill any size screen and which can be enlarged or shrunk to suit the preferences of the reader. Fixed layout EPUB features text and images that are always shown in the same positions on a page, regardless of the size of the screen. Indeed, they are often reduced in size to fit on smaller screens and are often barely illegible on mobile phones. Finally, flowable EPUB is better supported by a larger range of ereaders, fixed layout is available in only a few.</p>
<p>InDesigns print features ‚Äîincluding master pages and the control of headers and footers, and precise positioning of elements and text‚Äî are ignored in flowable EPUB documents. Flowable EPUB does permit choosing (initial) font-size, leading, font, space before and after a paragraph, whether a paragraph should begin on a new page, and more, though the reader may be able to partially or completelly override these settings in individual ereaders.</p>
<p>You can use InDesign just for EPUB production and not print. In this case, you can simply ignore how the book looks in print and focus on generating flexible EPUB documents that look good across a range of ereaders.</p>
<p>Underneath is a very short guide and InDesign is a very complex and complete software package. There are many more options than those described here.</p>
<h4 id="styles">Styles</h4>
<p>One of the most effective tools that InDesign offers is the ability to identify different kinds of paragraphs (headers, subheaders, body text, captions, etc) and apply a whole set of formatting rules to them‚Äîcalled a 'style' ‚Äî in one fell swoop. These styles can later be exported into EPUB in CSS format, enabling subsequent editing and adjustments, if necessary, in order to adapt to a range of different ereaders and/or offer a different look than in the print document. You must first create styles, then apply them, then make sure they are properly mapped for export to EPUB.</p>
<p><strong>Creating styles</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open the Paragraph Styles panel and click the New Style button to create a new style. Any formatting in the active paragraph is incorporated automatically into the new style.</li>
<li>Give the style a name.</li>
<li>Choose any additional options from the boxes at left, and save.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tips: You can also create Character Styles for applying formatting to just a selection of text rather than an entire paragraph. Applying all formatting with styles instead of local formatting improves reliability across ereaders and facilitates later editing.</p>
<p><strong>Apply styles</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click in a paragraph that you want to style. Choose the desired style from the Paragraph Styles panel that you wish to apply.</li>
<li>Repeat for every paragraph in the document.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tips: You can style all of the text at once by selecting all and then choosing the Body style. Then apply the less frequent headers and captions and other paragraphs individually. If you have imported a document with large quantities of existing bold or italic text, you can search and replace to automate applying the character style.</p>
<p><strong>Map styles to tags</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Though InDesign can do this step automatically, you can precisely specify which Paragraph Styles should be mapped to which tags in the resulting CSS to get more control.</li>
<li>Choose Edit All Export Tags from the Paragraph Styles Panel menu.</li>
<li>In the dialog box that appears, verify that each style is mapped as desired to the appropriate tag. It's a good idea, for example, for header paragraphs in your book to be output as h1, h2, etc. and for each style to have its own class. Tips: If you import XML documents, you can have InDesign automatically map specific XML tags to the desired Paragraph Styles (which later will be mapped to the proper EPUB CSS tags as above). Earlier versions of InDesign were not as good at exporting all of its styles to CSS. CC is substantially better. You can apply your own CSS in addition to or in substitution of the formatting from the styles from InDesign through the Export Options dialog box.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="images">Images</h4>
<p>InDesign has three kinds of images: inline, anchored and independent.</p>
<p>Inline images are placed or pasted directly within the text. When exported, they are rasterized (and thus if any inline objects contain text, this text is also rasterized), and exported in the flow of the text in which they are placed. Inline images cannot be wrapped with text.</p>
<p>Anchored images are tied to a particular part of the text, and when exported to EPUB will appear just before that text in the code. Anchored images can have text wrapped around them and are properly exported as floating objects in EPUB. Text within anchored groups of objects is not rasterized, but sometimes resizes incorrectly in ereaders.</p>
<p>Independent images are placed on the page adjacent to text and other objects, without any explicit link between the two. InDesign exports text and and independent image objects sequentially according to their location on the page, starting with those objects that are farther up and to the left. Because an entire story is exported before other objects on the same page, images may often appear several pages after the text in the EPUB than they did in the print version. The order of exported objects can be adjusted in the Articles panel.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring images</strong></p>
<p>Generally, it's more effective to use anchored images with text that will be exported to EPUB. This gives you more control over where the image appears in the exported EPUB and also permits the use of text wrap.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Place an image on the pasteboard. If desired, you can create a caption, style the caption, and then group the caption with the image</li>
<li>Select the image to make its controls visible.</li>
<li>Drag the blue box in the upper right corner of the image to the desired location in the text.</li>
<li>If the print output is important, adjust the location of the image. This does not affect the image's location in the EPUB.</li>
<li>If you want text to wrap around the image, select the image and then choose Object &gt; Object Export Options. 5.1. Display the EPUB and HTML options panel. 5.2. Check the Custom Layout option and then choose Float Left from the menu. 5.3. In order to specify the desired amount of space between the image and the text, choose the image, display the Text Wrap box, click the second option, and specify the amount of space in each box. You might also want to do this to adjust how the image appears in the print edition.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Links and cross references</strong></p>
<p>One of the main advantages of ebooks over print is that they can contain to additional information, whether it be in the same book, or on a web site somewhere out on the internet. InDesign makes it easy to incorporate links into your ebook.</p>
<p>There are two principal kinds of links: links in which you specify both the destination and the link text, and links that get the link text automatically from the destination. This second kind of links are called cross-references. It's a good idea to apply a character style to all kinds of links.</p>
<p><strong>Creating links within a book</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create the destination by selecting the point in the book where you want the link to point to, and then choosing New Hyperlink Destination from the Hyperlinks panel menu. Note the name of the Text Anchor, you'll need it later. It's usually the first few words of the destination text.</li>
<li>Select the text that you want to convert into a link and choose New Hyperlink from the Hyperlinks panel menu.<br /></li>
<li>Choose Text Anchor next to Link To:, choose the Document that the destination is in and then choose the name of the Text Anchor. It's a good idea to apply a style so that you can format all links later.</li>
<li>Click OK to create the link.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Creating cross references</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Cross references are links in which the text you click on is automatically generated from the text in the destination. A typical example for cross references is when you want to link to a different chapter or header name. You can tell InDesign to always use the most up to date text in the Header.</li>
<li>To create a cross reference, place the cursor in the text where the link will go.</li>
<li>Choose Window &gt; Type &amp; Tables &gt; Cross-References to view the Cross-References panel.</li>
<li>Choose Insert Cross-Reference.</li>
<li>Choose the desired document and then the kind of paragraph that you want to link to in the left half of the box. The specific paragraphs tagged with that style will show up on the right so you can choose the one you want for the cross-reference.</li>
<li>Select a Format for the Cross-Reference, and click OK.</li>
<li>The text from the destination appears in the body of your document. It will be exported as a link in the EPUB document.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>
<p>Ebooks have two different kinds of tables of contents, the conventional one that is part of the text, just like any other chapter in your book, but with links to the remaining chapters and sections, and one that is accessed through the menus of the user's ebook reader regardless of which page they're looking at at the moment. InDesign facilitates the creation of both types.</p>
<p>InDesign generates tables of contents from styled paragraphs. For example, you might want to create a table of contents with all of paragraphs marked with the Heading 1 and Heading 2 styles, or as in this example, with just all of the ChapName elements.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Table of Contents Style</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose Layout &gt; Table of Contents Styles and then click New in the dialog box that appears.</li>
<li>Give the table of contents a name, like &quot;Contents&quot; and choose the paragraph style that should be applied to that header in the book.</li>
<li>Choose the kind of paragraphs that should be used to populate the table of contents, like headings or chapter names.</li>
<li>Click More Options if it's not already chosen.</li>
<li>In the center area, choose the style that should be applied to each kind of element in the table of contents. It's a good idea to create special styles to be applied to these elements.</li>
<li>Choose No page number in the Page Number box since these are not necessary in an ebook.</li>
<li>Click OK to save the TOC Style. This is the first step to creating both a navigational and in-document table of contents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Generate the in-document table of contents</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Once you've created a TOC Style, choose Layout &gt; Table of Contents to have InDesign generate the table of contents by extracting the text from the paragraphs marked with the styles you selected.</li>
<li>With the &quot;loaded&quot; pointer, place the table of contents in the desired location of the document. You don't have to put the table of contents at the front of the book, or indeed include it all.</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll learn how to generate the navigational table of contents in the Export Options section of this guide.</p>
<p>Tips: If you export a multi-document book to EPUB and don't create a Table of contents style, InDesign automatically creates a TOC based on the file names of the individual documents in the book. If you export a single document book to EPUB, InDesign will not automatically generate a table of contents. You can create a navigational table of contents or an in-document table of contents or both. Most ereaders will throw an error if the navigational TOC is not present. Some ebook stores will complain if you don't include an in-document TOC.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata</strong> Metadata is information about your book, including the names of the author and other creators, the publisher, date of publication, subject matter, and more. It's a good idea to provide as much metadata as possible to make it easy for prospective readers to find your book.</p>
<p>InDesign gives you two opportunities to add metadata, in the File Info dialog box and when you export your file to EPUB. The two sets of information overlap but are not identical. Further, only empty fields are overwritten by data in the other system.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to File &gt; Info to add metadata to your file about the name of your publication, the author, a description, keywords, and copyright status.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can add additional metadata as you export the document to EPUB as discussed further ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Cover</strong> The final step before you export to EPUB is to create and add a cover for your ebook. Because ebook covers are often viewed at small sizes, it's important to have large, clear text and to preview the cover at icon size. Most ebook stores ask for images that are at least 1000 pixels on the shortest side.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Save the cover image as a JPEG.</li>
</ol>
<p>You specify the cover image when you actually export to EPUB in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Export options</strong> Before exporting to EPUB make sure that all formatting is applied with styles, all images are properly placed and anchored, you've created all the links needed, there is a defined Table of Contents style, you've specified as much metadata as necessary and desired, and you've created a high-resolution cover image that can be viewed adequately at small sizes.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start by choosing File &gt; Export and then choose a filename and destination, and EPUB (Reflowable) in the Format menu. Click OK. The EPUB - Reflowable Layout Export Options box appears with eight separate panels of options.</li>
<li>In the General panel, choose EPUB 3.0 next to Version to ensure your document is up to the latest standards.</li>
<li>Select Choose image next to Cover, and then click the folder to select the desired cover image that you created earlier. If you choose Rasterize Front Page, InDesign creates a screenshot of the first page of your book and uses that for the cover.</li>
<li>Next to Navigation TOC choose Multi Level (TOC Style) and then choose the Table of Contents Style that you created earlier in the TOC Style menu.</li>
<li>Click the Metadata panel</li>
<li>Insert the book's ISBN in the Identifier field, if it has one.</li>
<li>All the other fields besides the Date field should be automatically populated with data entered in the File Info box earlier. You can add any missing information now. InDesign uses the information in the Date field for the EPUB 2.0 dc:date element but will always automatically set the EPUB 3.0 compatible date format with the export date and time. In other words, you don't have to put anything in the Date field.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many other export options, for controlling the way images and text are exported, for adding JavaScript and CSS, and for choosing how the ebook should be previewed. Explore these at your leisure. The CSS is possibly Liz Castro her favorite option since it allows you to override or even completely substitute the sometimes bulky and awkward CSS generated by InDesign with your own carefully crafted CSS.</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Finally, click OK to generate the EPUB file.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Testing</strong> Be sure to test the EPUB file in as many ereaders as possible. You can use Kindle Previewer to open the EPUB in a Kindle simulator and/or to convert the EPUB to Kindle format so that you can test it on actual Kindle devices.</p>
<p><strong>Validating</strong> It's always a good idea to validate your EPUB documents with ePubCheck [^EpubCheck] before you release them.</p>
<p>Now your EPUB is ready! It can be opened and enjoyed in an ereader like Calibre, iBooks or a similar application.</p>
<h2 id="do-it-yourself-epub-using-pandoc">Do it yourself EPUB using pandoc</h2>
<p>Two popular conversion programs that can convert from a wide variety of input formats and produce EPUBs are pandoc (see also chapter 6 <!-- internal link needed-->) and Calibre's conversion tool.<a href="#fn75" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, consider <em>Beowulf</em> available from Project Gutenberg in a variety of formats (including EPUB). The 'plain text' version [^plaintext], is the complete text of the book in a single file with no styling (no fonts, sizes, or bold etc). We can use this to show how a simple conversion to EPUB works.</p>
<p>To make an EPUB of <em>Beowulf</em>, download the 'plain text' version (the complete text of the book in a single file with no styling). <a href="#fn76" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In your Documents folder, make a sub folder named 'pandoc-test'. This is the folder where we‚Äôll store and retrieve documents to be converted and which are made by pandoc. Save the file in this folder with the name beowulf.txt. Download and install pandoc. <a href="#fn77" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Pandoc is working in the so-called command line mode and not in a user interface environment. Hence you can‚Äôt ‚Äòopen‚Äô the program and don‚Äôt see an icon. To convert the file into an EPUB follow the steps below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>First open the file with Microsoft Word or a similar program. Save the file as a docx-document, in the same folder called 'pandoc-test'.</p></li>
<li><p>Pandoc is a command-line tool. There is no graphic user interface. So to use it, you‚Äôll need to open a terminal window:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Windows: To start pandoc type cmd in the RUN (also called ‚Äòsearch programs and files‚Äô in the start panel which can be found under the MS window icon down in the toolbar), this will enable you to start the command mode. You'll get a white/black window saying C:\user\yourusername&gt;. There you type pandoc (enter) and the same line reappears, waiting for pandoc input (see further below).<!-- Double \ used to espace meta value of \ in Mardown and display C:\\ literaly  --></p>
<p>Mac: To use pandoc open the Terminal from your Utilities folder in your Applications folder, or through the search bar in the top right of your screen. Pandoc will be used to convert files in the steps below. Note: Pandoc does not work on older Mac operating systems.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the Terminal and type cd Documents. This means the Terminal will ‚Äòchange directory‚Äô to the Documents folder.</li>
<li>Now type cd pandoc-test. The Terminal will change directory to the folder within the Documents folder called pandoc-test. Now you can work with the documents in there.</li>
<li>On Mac, type ls [l as in lima, referring to ‚Äòlist‚Äô], on Windows dir to get a list of files in the current folder. The beowulf.docx should be listed.</li>
<li><p>To convert the file from docx to EPUB, type the following into the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc beowulf.docx -f docx -t epub -s -o beowulf.epub</code></pre></li>
<li>The filename beowulf.docx tells pandoc which file to convert, -f docx -t epub, so from docx to EPUB. The -s option says to create a ‚Äòstandalone‚Äô file, with a header and footer, not just a fragment. And the -o beowulf.epub says to put the output in a file named beowulf.epub. (Note: in Mac you can copy-paste the command, in Windows you can‚Äôt copy-paste.)</li>
<li>Check that the file was created by typing ls or dir again. You should see beowulf.epub.</li>
<li><p>Open the EPUB from the folder or in the Terminal type</p>
<pre><code>open beowulf.epub </code></pre></li>
<li><p>Note that you can also start from Markdown. Then open the text file in your Markdown editor and save as a markdown file. Type the following command in pandoc to convert into EPUB:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc beowulf.md -f markdown -t epub -s -o beowulf.epub</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cleaning-up-markdown">Cleaning up Markdown</h3>
<p>Since Markdown is a document format and not a word processing program, it does not offer functions like automatic renumbering of footnotes and list items during text editing. In fact, such numbers don't matter since everything will be renumbered during the document conversion anyway.</p>
<p>However, to also make the Markdown text source coherent and tidy, pandoc can be used to clean it up. The trick is to tell pandoc to convert a document from Markdown to Markdown:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc -f markdown -t markdown --output markdown-document-clean.txt markdown-document.txt</code></pre>

<h1 id="guide-epublications-per-genre">08 Guide: Epublications per Genre</h1>
<h2 id="general-questions">General questions</h2>
<h2 id="research-publication-1"><a href="id:Research%20publication">Research publication</a></h2>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p>Currently, there are intense discussions about changing the forms of research publications in both sciences and humanities. The idea is to transition from the classical textbook model to new forms of publication that allow more complex forms of visualization, inclusion of real-time data, and computation. One would normally expect that electronic publishing provides the technical solution for these issues. However, this is not today's reality. If one wants to publish in standard e-book formats and target a broad range of electronic reading platforms and devices, the visual and multimedia possibilities of current e-book technology are, as a matter of fact, much more limited than in paper publishing. The alternative, to develop research publications as visual apps, will in most cases not be a viable solution because apps have short lifespans of technical compatibility while research publishing is long-term (and long-tail) publishing almost by definition.</p>
<p>Pragmatically and for the near future, electronic research publishing will mean the publishing of conventionally designed papers, journals and textbooks in electronic form. This means that electronic research publishing will typically evolve around text-centered works.</p>
<p>This means that the advice given for <a href="researchlikepub.html">research-type publications</a> elsewhere in this publication will apply to most electronic research publications.</p>
<h3 id="traditional-workflow">Traditional workflow</h3>
<p>In print research publications, the typical workflow has been</p>
<ul>
<li>An editor works with author(s) on the manuscript.</li>
<li>Several versions of the manuscript are going back and forth between different people in different roles (editor, author, copyeditor, designer).</li>
<li>The final version of the manuscript will be established in a word processing program (typically Microsoft Word) or desktop publishing program (typically Adobe InDesign).</li>
<li>A graphic designer will design the publication in InDesign.<br /></li>
<li>Corrections are made to the print proof and added in the InDesign file.<br /></li>
<li>A PDF file of the corrected InDesign file goes to printer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Chapter 7 <!-- internal link needed-->we describe a workflow on how to create electronic books from an InDesign project. However, this entails careful planning and meticulous internal structuring of the InDesign document that is untypical for the way book projects are being made today, and for which most graphic designers working with InDesign have not been trained.</p>
<h3 id="new-workflow">New workflow</h3>
<p>We propose a new workflow that is directed towards diverse sources and hybrid output to various media (including print, e-book and web). It is centered around a single editorial and archival file format, a definitive version of the document that enables multiple output. Instead of a final Word file which is changed in InDesign - both of which are not very good formats to convert to EPUB ‚Äì the editorial and archivale file will be in a format that can easily translate into InDesign for the print edition and EPUB / mobi / web for the electronic publication. The most suitable format for this is Markdown with the MultiMarkdown extensions - because it allows footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies, and translation to InDesign, EPUB and Web is very straightforward using the Open Source software tool pandoc.</p>

<h3 id="new-possibilities">New possibilities</h3>
<p>A hybrid workflow geared towards e-publications as well as print, offers a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy translation into various electronic file formats, as explained above;</li>
<li>User-friendly like Wikis and blogs can be used for collaborative editing and revision control, or even more sophisticated systems like Git/GitHub (that are traditionally used for software development by large teams of programmers distributed over the whole world);<br /></li>
<li>Adding elements other than text (videos, images, links) while keeping them separate from the document file. This prevents gigantic file sizes of the central editorial document. It also makes it easier to maintain images and videos in different resolutions for different publication media.</li>
<li>Easy extraction of derived output from the book itself, such as abstracts, video book trailers, newsletters, personalized e-publications; easier extraction of parts of a publication that will be separately published.</li>
<li>Independence from one particular software program (such as Word and InDesign), long-time achivability.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
<h4 id="style-guide">Style guide</h4>
<p>A new workflow requires certain actions to obtain the suitable input for the publication. First of all, it is necessary to communicate this to all contributors (authors, editors, designers) in the publishing process. Publication style guides must be adjusted accordingly and specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>the file format to be delivered by contributors (for example: Markdown, or .docx pending later conversion and formatting clean-up);</li>
<li>in case of the use the Word/.docx, require the author to use defined paragraph and character styles for all formatting (such as &quot;Headline 1&quot;, &quot;Headline 2&quot;, &quot;quotation&quot; etc.) - and to strictly avoid direct formatting of text. Microsoft provides <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Style-basics-in-Word-d382f84d-5c38-4444-98a5-9cbb6ede1ba4">a useful introduction</a> on this;</li>
<li>image style and format; high-resolution images that are suitable for print but can be downsized to lower resolutions for electronic publication;<br /></li>
<li>metadata the author needs to provide such as keywords, contact information, abstract, biography;</li>
<li>metadata to be added by the editor/publisher.</li>
</ul>
<p>Editorial criteria for the content can also differ in a hybrid workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>differents style of writing, 'writing for the web' vs. 'writing for print;<br /></li>
<li>the inclusion of interactive material, more or other images than can be published in print, video, audio, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="decision-making">Decision making</h3>
<p>Should there be a 1:1 transfer from paper book to ebook?, What are alternative possibilities?</p>
<p>In most cases, today, an art catalogue is difficult to translate 1:1 to an electronic publication, simply because of file sizes. It's advisable to split it up into smaller publications, such as monographic micro-ebooks on single art works, or collections of articles that each reader can individually choose from and obtain as an automatically customized e-book.</p>
<h3 id="instructions-1">Instructions</h3>
<p>1:1 translations into electronic publication: target one reading medium (in most cases: tablets). Strongly consider PDF over EPUB if the focus is on images, and image composition requires a fixed layout. Target a 10&quot; tablet screen with a resolution between 1024x768 and 1920x1080. Work in InDesign, and make - if necessary - a customized new page layout that fits these dimensions. Consider small additions of interactive and multimedia elements by using Adobe Acrobat Pro as a final authoring tool. (This is part of the Adobe Creative Suite). Consider this project a short- to medium-term project that might have become technically obsolete/outmoded in 3-5 years.</p>
<p>Custom translation into modularized publications: EPUB is the file format of choice because it is internally modular (being nothing more than a zip archive of individual HTML files, images, fonts etc). Have a web developer program a simple custom server application that can customize, zip and upload an EPUB file according to a user's web form input. Also consider generating this EPUB from a database/content management system.</p>
<h3 id="specific-issues-for-this-publication-type">Specific issues for this publication type</h3>
<p>Above all: file size because of number and resolution of included images. Solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Modularize content (by in-app download, see for an example the Stedelijk project)</p></li>
<li><p>Create separate low-res and hi-res versions; can also be used as a business model (free or cheap low-res book, pay for hi-res book). Explain how on-the-fly resolution adjustment is easy with epub (using server-side scripting for resizing images and zipping the epub file), this is not so easy with PDF.</p></li>
<li><p>Question/issue: Is a catalogue in the traditional definition a desirable publication format for e-publishing, or do we (a) have to think up new forms of small/smart catalogues, or (b) wait for more device storage capacity and network speed to arrive in the future? At the moment, producing a 100+ pages hi-resolution catalogue electronically does not make sense, except as heavy PDF files for desktop computer viewing. <!-- Pia: why doesnt this make sense?--></p></li>

<p>How to make an arts/design periodical in EPUB2/3, HTML5 (/app), PDF</p>
<p>A step-by-step guide</p>
<p>Advantages, disadvantages</p>
<!--Florian's text:-->
<p>Lately, artists' and designer's books have grown from a niche phenomenon to a major genre within arts and design publishing. It could be argued that the book as an art or design object in its own right has become more prominent now that the function of the book as a generic carrier of information (such as in a telephone directory, a dictionary or a run-of-the-mill novel or non-fiction paperback) is increasingly taken over by the World Wide Web and by ereaders.</p>
<h4 id="transfer-from-paper-to-electronic">Transfer from paper to electronic?</h4>
<p>The more medium-specific an artist's book is, the less sense it makes to translate it 1:1 into an electronic book. Dieter Roth's sculptural book objects <!--Pia: insert footnote-->, for example, would change from book art works to mere depictions of book art works when reproduced electronically.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many contemporary artists, designers and media activists experimented with electronic publishing as a 'poor' (i.e. simple low tech) medium of social sharing rather than a 'rich' visual and tactile medium:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the 1980s and early 1990s, many makers of zines (do-it-yourself small press periodicals) became makers of <em>e-zines</em>, electronic zines that used dial-up computer bulletin boards and the Internet as noncommercial samizdat media. Their typical publication format were simple plain text files.<a href="#fn78" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Many e-zines worked around their technical limitations by using ASCII art, typograms as they had also been produced in 1960s and 70s concrete poetry on typewriters, and with homebrew formatting codes ('_' for underlines, '#' for headlines etc.), the immediate precursors of the Markdown format described here in this toolkit.</li>
<li>In the early 1990s, there also existed a hacker culture of 'disk mags' for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST home computers. These electronic magazines were anonymously published on floppy disks and were based on self-written computer programs (factually, early 'apps') that displayed their animated text and visual contents.</li>
<li>Since the late 1990s, there have been a number of artist-run sites * textz.com, ubu.com, aaaaarg.org, monoskop.org - that offer free downloads of cultural theory and arts-related books, typically in simple formats such as plain text, PDF and EPUB. In these examples, the focus is not on the book as a visual object, but on concepts and politics of its sharing and dissemination; in other words, artists' publishing as electronic samizdat. In such scenarios, artists' publishing as simple 1:1 transfers from print originals to electronic reproductions can make sense.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="technical-solutions-for-samizdat-publications">Technical solutions for samizdat publications <!--Pia: introduce term samizdat pls --></h5>
<p>For such activist or minimalist projects, the lowest technical denominator and most easily readable file formats are advisable:</p>
<ul>
<li>plain text (ASCII) as the most simple, compatible and minimalist solution</li>
<li>single-file HTML. It is possible to directly embed images into an HTML file (without providing them as separate files); technical instructions can be found <a href="...">here</a>. <!--Amy: empty link! --></li>
<li>PDF. This format is widely readable and best suited for faithfully reproducing print books, but limited in its readability on different devices and hardly editable (more explanation <a href="...">here</a>).<!--Amy: empty link! --></li>
<li>EPUB. This format is factually just HTML for offline reading, with improved publication meta data and improved compatibility to ereaders. Projects can very easily be made and provided both in HTML and EPUB. Since the design of most samizdat books does not differ from that of <a href="#Research%20publication">research publications</a> or other visually simple publishing formats, no special design advice is necessary here, except the principle of 'worse is better': the smaller the file size, the most compatible and universally readable the file format, the better, even if this comes at the expense of typographic and visual quality. An plain text files, then, might be preferable to a nicely designed PDF file. <!-- Silvio suggests also to focus on the technical solution for  sharing texts, like etherpad, textb.org --></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-make-visually-oriented-artists-books">How to make visually oriented artists' books</h4>
<h5 id="pre-history-and-general-issues">Pre-history and general issues</h5>
<p>There is, factually, a rich tradition of artists' audiovisual electronic books: It began in the 1990s with hypertext and interactive multimedia literary experiments on floppy disk, CD-ROMs, later web sites and mobile apps. The Electronic Literature Organization<a href="#fn79" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> and the international research project ELMCIP<a href="#fn80" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> document it extensively. Much of this documentation has become media archeology since multimedia formats have become obsolete: CD-ROM applications that no longer run on contemporary computers, websites whose links or plug-ins are no longer working or not compatible to today's browsers anymore.</p>
<p>This problem was greater in the 1990s and early 2000s when working open, cross-platform multimedia standards barely existed. But even today, the rule explained in chapter ... <!-- cross-reference to Arjen's overview graph of non-visual vs. visual epublishing technologies--> still applies: The more complex the audiovisuality of an electronic book, the less compatible it will be to all kinds of different electronic reading devices, and the more technical updates it will likely need over the course of time. <!-- Silvio: This problem was also exemplified by the massive use of Flash by e-lit artists --></p>
<h5 id="simple-solutions">Simple solutions</h5>
<p>Electronic visual books can be made in very simple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a sequence of images, embedded into an EPUB file <!-- add reference-->, a self-contained HTML file <!-- add reference--> or a PDF file.</li>
<li>As a PDF file. This is generally the most easy-to-use straightforward format for visual publications in a universally working format. However, for long-time durability, the PDF/A format is preferable to run-of-the mill PDF.<a href="#fn81" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> PDF documents can be graphically designed to work on different screen sizes, and resolution of embedded visuals can be decreased to keep the file size friendly for downloading. Still, the format is essentially limited to fixed document sizes and remains an electronic representation of printed matter.</li>
<li>Other standard file formats creatively (ab)used as document formats for visual books: animated GIF graphics files for the digital equivalent of flip books, for example, <strong>mp4</strong> video files displaying a real-time book, mp3 audio files triggering abstract art on the volume meter display of an audio player, JPEG files with encoding artefacts of corrupted bits.<a href="#fn82" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> <!-- should this be mentioned as simple? not all of these formats work on e-readers. mention reference to image of Arjen or overview of strengths and weaknesses --></li>
<li>Self-contained HTML. <!-- explain the use of self-contained HTML with base64--></li>

<h3 id="decision-making-2">Decision making</h3>
<p>Should it be a 1:1 transfer from paper book to e-journal? There are now gradual transitions from traditional to new workflows in digital magazine publishing which break up the old-vs-new dichotomy. On this scale, providing a magazine as a downloadable PDF file is the most traditional solution, and turning the magazine into a website (running on a content management systems such as WordPress) the least traditional. On the upside, all these technical solutions are now mature thanks to 20 years of online news publishing.</p>
<h3 id="instructions-3">Instructions</h3>
<p>See above.</p>
<h3 id="specific-issues-for-this-publication-type-2">Specific issues for this publication type</h3>
<p>The main issue is to which extent the integrity of the publication as <em>one</em> medium is important, or whether to entirely give up the traditional system of periodical appearance in bundled issues. Alternatively, the model could be (a) a continuously updated web site (similar to a news website or a blog), (b) focus on providing single articles rather than bundled issues based on search engine hits, social media recommendations etc. In the end, there is no hard difference between a &quot;blog&quot; and a &quot;magazine&quot; online.</p>

<!-- Silvio: Adobe Digital Editions is the software used to read and manage e-books: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/it/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html">http://www.adobe.com/it/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html</a>

<p>A consistent design and uniform interactivity across devices could be a requirement, in which case a reflowable document might not be the ideal solution. Some publishers opt to develop their own (mobile) applications, like The Guardian's iOS <a href="#fn83" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> version of their newspaper, the amplified ebooks by Penguin <a href="#fn84" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> or the children's book by Purple Carrot <a href="#fn85" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a>. These solutions offer fine-grained control over user interaction and consistency of design, but come with the extra cost of hiring a development team to engineer the application. Also, publishing for different platforms is not that straightforward. Code written specifically with the iOS <strong>SDK (Software Development Kit)</strong> in mind will likely require a lot of editing before it's ready to run on the Android platform. Portability is another issue, it's fairly easy to transfer an EPUB to another device, however application binaries are not that easily passed around, mostly due to the relatively closed nature of mobile operating systems.</p>
<p>Lastly, why not just publish essays, articles or even whole books on a website? The wealth of weblogs and other publishing platforms shows that this is a viable form of publishing. Monetising is less straightforward, most websites generate income by showing advertisements or sponsored articles. Paid membership is also used as a business model by some websites, like <em>De Correspondent</em> <a href="#fn86" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a>. One of the major downsides is that content will only be available online and cannot be easily passed around as a single unit of information like an EPUB or a PDF.</p>
<h2 id="authoring-suites">Authoring Suites</h2>
<p>A range of publishing suites is available as well, which roughly fall into two categories. One can be described as full-blown editors, the other allows publishers to enhance existing publications with interactive features.</p>
<h3 id="editors-calibre">Editors: Calibre</h3>
<!-- Miriam: why is Calibre called an editor here?-->
<p>Calibre <a href="#fn87" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> is a 'swiss army knife' for reading, converting, authoring and cataloging e-books. It is open source, runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (with identical graphical interfaces on all these platforms) and is under very active development with frequent version updates. We recommend it as a standard tool for all ebook publishers next to pandoc and consider it superior to (older) alternatives like Sigil.<a href="#fn88" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The inexpensive commercial program Jutoh<a href="#fn89" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a>, which also runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, is superior as an easy-to-use graphical editor for ebooks since it gives writers and editors a user interface similar to that of Microsoft Word. Jutoh is less powerful as a document converter and ebook database.</p>
<p>Calibre can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>open and read EPUB files on a personal computer;</p></li>
<li><p>import various documents in various ebook and electronic text formats (including .docx, rtf, HTML and plain text) and convert them into EPUB; export to other document formats including Amazon Kindle, PDF and RTF.</p></li>
<li><p>manage a local library/database of all imported ebooks, with easy editing of the bibliographic meta data of each ebook;</p></li>
<li><p>synchronize the user's ebook library with ereading devices;</p></li>
<li><p>edit ebooks in HTML source code, with live graphical preview.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Calibre calls itself 'the one stop solution to all your ebook needs'. And indeed, (small) publishers could use it as their single, one-size-fits-all tool for ebook production. If one wants to create text-oriented, standard-compliant ebooks, Calibre is the most accessible and straightforward authoring software currently available.</p>
<p>However, at its current version 2.5, Calibre is not perfect. For some aspects, other programs provide better functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Calibre's user interface is cluttered and can be confusing. The program has so many features and modules that it can feel like several programs jammed into one.</p></li>
<li><p>The editor only supports EPUB 2.0 and is meant for tweaking the HTML and CSS code of imported documents, not for editing ebooks from scratch. That said, it provides good live graphical previews of the formatted document. Still, the editor is not the right tool for visual/multimedia-oriented publications.</p></li>
<li><p>The import/document conversion function is inferior to pandoc. In our tests, we obtained clearly better results converting Microsoft Word .docx and Markdown files to epub with pandoc than with Calibre. Calibre has the advantage of easy graphical operation, as opposed to the non-graphical command line interface of pandoc.</p></li>
<li><p>Calibre's graphical viewer uses a simple HTML engine that is insufficient for testing and evaluating the visual design of an ebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Calibre's PDF export provides no real alternative to a PDF document carefully designed in a program like InDesign, or with custom templates using XML or other document formats. Here, pandoc is superior to Calibre as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these limitations, Calibre is a capable program for importing simple text documents, tweaking them into an ebook and exporting it to the most common ebook formats.</p>
<p>Currently, the technically easiest and least expensive way of hybrid publishing is to transform a book into Markdown, edit the Markdown into a structurally clean document, use pandoc for converting Markdown to EPUB , and import the EPUB into Calibre for final tweaks and conversion into other e-book formats (including Amazon Kindle).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/09_calibre.png" alt="Calibre Workflow" /><p class="caption">Calibre Workflow</p>
</div>
<p>In a perfect future, Calibre would use pandoc as its import and document conversion engine, Readium for displaying e-books, and its document editor would be on par with iBooks Author for multimedia design while maintaining full compliance to the EPUB3 standard.</p>
<h3 id="enhancers-adobe-digital-publishing-suite-mag">Enhancers: Adobe Digital Publishing Suite, Mag+</h3>
<p>These applications mostly integrate (as plugins) in an existing Adobe InDesign and allow designers to define interactive content (media, animations, etc.) in a traditional print design.

These works can be made of everything, but more often than not they deal with tactile objects, paintings, drawings, sculptures, etc. In many books these works are reproduced and discussed. But writing itself is also an art form and the mutual interaction between texts and tactile objects becomes more and more integrated. In the 20s and 30s of the previous century collages became very popular. Here texts, newspaper clippings, photographs and any other expressions, mostly on a paper substrate were put together to obtain a new artwork. In an electronic environment we transcend this collage technique into a new substrate: the pixel screen. Now, an enormous range of novel opportunities for creative expression becomes possible.</p>
<p>As we showed before in this guide, the act of glueing, dissecting and endlessly reorganizing enables us to create new works that can express themselves differently in different technological environments as well as being tailored to the readers‚Äôs desire of the moment of consumption. Electronic publishing becomes like a gigantic fruit salad bar, where the end user is able to or fill her own plate or to make a choice between prepared combinations. This not the same as blending all ingredients into one smoothie, which is an end phase from where no way back is possible. Below, we discuss some actual trends, though as we have seen over the past years the predictive power of fashion and hype is limited. <a href="http://digitalpublishingtoolkit.org/?p=921" title="Link to blog post: Book review. The end of ebooks. 20 visionaries on the future of digital reading."><img src="images/dpt_blog_verwijzing.png" alt="Bloglink" /></a></p>
<h2 id="reading-technology">Reading technology</h2>
<p>Changes seem dependent on genre, just as hard- and software dependencies. We have to take the intrinsic limitations of the latter two into account. Reading novels or other linear texts on ereaders is already a big success. Publishers report an ever increasing sales of eversions, that will surpass the sales of paper publications.<a href="#fn91" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The open question is still are those books and articles read from screen or downloaded and print on paper. On the many self-publishing sites and web sites of official publishers we see millions of publications. But again, are all these works read sequentially like a detective or browsed/scrolled? How to handle a anthology with hundred poems?</p>
<p>Also we see a saturation in the market of ereaders. Early birds like Sony are ending their efforts. This might be a result of the conflation of ereaders and the larger screen sizes of smartphones. Reading from a large smartphone becomes quite feasible. Typically, the big consumer electronics companies, stop developing ereaders in a market that is already mature and leave further advances to intermediates like Kobo.com. That is to say, hardware improvements are more or less on a plateau level and the real challenge will be the usages, which means the reading software, of ebooks. Browsing, annotating, sharing and quoting demands further software developments to mimic the versatility of paper books.</p>
<p>This goes without saying the intrinsic technological developments into color epaper screens, flexible screens and the continuing improvement of screen resolution Ultra High resolution (aka 4K) will certainly become something like Exa High in due course.</p>
<p>Also the big issue of reading from screen versus print-on-demand remains an open question.<a href="#fn92" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Again, it very much depends on the genre. Resent research shows that with the actual state of the art, students prefer paper above screens in the process of preparing for tests.<a href="#fn93" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> So in the field of educational texts a new mixture will arise where paper textbooks and electronic examples, image, audio, and film collections and tests are written/developed in close collaboration. Also here textbooks loaded with pictures in fields like clinical medicine and art history will deviate from textbooks on theology and literature studies. Experiments will take a long time as evaluating educational courses takes many years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, advantages and disadvantages will remain the same on the level of affordability and portability of whole libraries versus independence from electricity and visual-tactile advantages of paper books. Related to this is the cloud hype, a fantastic development that relies totally on the availability of electricity and a working internet connection as well as the consistency of the host's services and platforms. Not to mention the 'anti-terrorist' filters of 'citizen friendly' governments.</p>
<h2 id="reading-culture">Reading culture</h2>
<p>Apart from the concerns expressed above, we have to review the culture of reading again. The present culture is that a person gets or buys a book and that is it. Now, more and more we are drifting to subscription models where the content as well as the software needed for consuming that content becomes unstable.</p>
<p>Cost pressure that now chases us in the direction of cheaper ebooks might result in a dangerous dependency on a livelong financial contract.<a href="#fn94" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> People living in poor, closed or financially weak countries might need a stable stock of material next to the unstable internet structure and related censorship.</p>
<p>A major point in the present day discussion is the question of literacy. Nicolas Carr scared the world with his book <em>The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains</em> and on many internet forums and in many journals and magazines the discussions are vivid. We simple don't know. On the one hand people in many countries are trained by reading long texts and this competency might be influenced. On the other hand millions and millions of people from an illiterate background in non-western countries get superb reading and writing skills by the use of mobile phones and tablets. On top of that in the Islamic world we know a strong oral tradition which is presently reflected in the avalanche of (often political of religious) video messages. Hence, in our project scope where we deal with arts and design we have to consider a increasing mixture of various medial productions. The accent now is more and more on short texts and the integration of short videos. Nothing and nobody can forecast if in a more mature technological environment the tides will turn and, next to other expressions, long written story telling will as well as well printed picture books will be come fashionable again.</p>
<p>Other ways of dealing with texts allow a more interactive relationship between reader and text. Not only in the sense of adding audio and video, but also leaving the reader the choice of entry into the text, setting out an individual reader path per person.</p>
<p>On the level of popularity and commerce we have to realise that the increasing -advertising driven- use of statistics, such as Facebook's like will highly influence the choice of our readers who have to many options to fill their spare time.</p>
<h2 id="publishing-culture">Publishing culture</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, the subscription model now becomes the hegemonic model for the coming period. This will pertain to kind of products including books. However, here again we deal with a great variety. Big scholarly repositories such as JSTOR are different from sale platforms such as Amazon. Listening to relatively short music tracks (mostly less than 10 minutes) via Spotify is different than reading relatively long texts (mostly longer than one hour). Likely: switch from individual product retail to rental/subscription model. Though the distribution model between music and text might converge.</p>
<p>Given the great number of increasingly more powerful software writers and artist will try and disseminate their works more by who self-publish. However, at a certain point of overproduction, new intermediates, that is to say, publishers will pay a role again.</p>
<p>For the publishers themselves it means that they more than ever must target to become the aggregator then the one time off producer. Sale platforms like Amazon become so large that they disable themselves to become coherent sources.</p>
<p>Publishing always had in essence an editorial kernel. Unfortunately over the years it became more and more an industry of too many standardized products, where commercial short term objectives are the rue. With the advent of many self-publishing, vanity press, publishers that also rent out editorial services such as language brushing-up the 'art' and craftsmanship of publishing will re-establish herself in prioritizing the content, in his multimedia clothing, as linchpin between the creative artist and writer and the receptive reader, watcher, consumer. Our Toolkit tries to be a helpful step in this direction.</p>

<!-- not in text (Miriam)#####Aliasing, anti-aliasing
Pictures on your computer monitor are made up of square pixels. When the edge of a solid colored object in a GIF image is a diagonal or curved line, and it is displayed against a contrasting color, the edges appear jagged, like stair steps. This jagged appearance is called aliasing. The jagged appearance can be softened by filling in adjacent pixels with intermediate colors between the object and the background. This softening of the edges is called anti-aliasing. Software like Photoshop can apply anti-aliasing for you automatically. One problem with anti-aliasing GIF images is that it increases the number of colors used, necessarily increasing the file size. You must decide whether quick loading or smoothed edges serves your needs better.-->

<h5 id="dots-per-inch-dpi">Dots per inch (DPI)</h5>
<p>A measure of the quality of output, i.e. the number of dots per square inch produced by a printer or scanner, also referred to as its resolution. A resolution of at least 300 dpi is considered reasonable for the production of high-quality output by a printer and 1200 dpi by a scanner, but modern printers and scanners can produce many more dots per square inch. The resolution of a scanner may also be expressed by two numbers. These are mostly the same, e.g. 1200 x 1200, but you may also see 1200 x 2400, which means that the number of horizontal dots is different from the number of vertical dots.</p>

<h5 id="file">File</h5>
<p>'File' can be used to describe many different things: a computer program, a document file created with a word processor, an image file, an audio file, a video file, etc. A file has a name that describes what it is, and is stored in a certain place.</p>
<h5 id="file-extension">File extension</h5>
<p>A method used by many operating systems including Windows and Mac OS is to determine the format of a file based on the end of its name: the letters following the final period. This portion of the filename is known as the filename extension. For example, HTML documents are identified by names that end with .html (or .htm), and GIF images by .gif. In the past names were limited to an eight-character identifier and a three-character extension. There are only a limited number of three-letter extensions, so a given extension might be linked to more than one program. Many formats still use three-character extensions even though modern operating systems and application programs no longer have this limitation. There is no standard list of extensions.</p>
<h5 id="file-format">File format</h5>
<p>A file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. It specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium. File formats may be either proprietary or free and may be either unpublished or open. A specific file format demands specific programs to read.</p>

The POD model in this sense deviates from traditional printing, where large quantities of books are produced in initial print runs to reduce costs prior to distribution. POD has also changed the publishing industry by reducing the need for traditional publishing houses, allowing authors to self-publish at very low costs. Print-on-demand is sometimes called publish-on-demand.</p>
<h5 id="program">Program</h5>
<!-- The American spelling is standard in computer jargon, enabling a useful distinction to be made in British English between a *computer program* and a *programme* in the sense of a *programme of study*.

<h5 id="streaming">Streaming</h5>
<p>Playing audio or video in real time from a website. In order to play streaming multimedia files you need a specific plug-in program that links in with your browser and plays the file as it is transmitted rather than downloading it to your computer first. Streaming requires a broadband connection to the internet since multimedia files are not stored on your computer but played in a continuous stream direct from the computer where they are stored.</p>
<h5 id="syntax">Syntax</h5>
<h3 id="t"><strong>T</strong></h3>
<p><em>Tablet Computer</em> A tablet computer is compact portable computer that makes use of a Touchscreen instead of a keyboard for typing and running applications. Apple's iPad is a typical example of a tablet computer.</p>
<p><em>Tag</em> Tags are small alpha-numeric indicators around a word or part of text to define the role and/or function of that text. It is an essential tool in XML and HTML.</p>
<p>Tagging has become more common in recent years as a result of the widespread use of Social Media for sharing images, audio recordings, video recordings, website references, etc. Tags are labels that briefly describe the what the media or references are all about and help other people find them quickly.</p>
<p><em>TCP/IP (Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)</em> The main data transfer protocol used on the Internet.</p>
<p><em>Tex</em></p>
<p><em>Text editor</em> A computer program that allow the manipulation of text.</p>
<h5 id="tiff">Tiff</h5>
<p><em>Tumblog</em> A tumblog is similar to a blog. Whereas the full name for a blog is &quot;Web log,&quot; the full name for a tumblog is a &quot;tumble log.&quot; It is named <em>tumble</em> because it is designed for posting quick snippets instead of long articles.</p>
<h3 id="u"><em>U</em></h3>
<p><em>Unicode</em> The Unicode Worldwide Character Standard is a character coding system designed to support the interchange, processing, and display of the written texts of the diverse languages of the modern world.

<h3 id="v"><em>V</em></h3>
<p><em>Vector Graphic</em> A method of creating graphic images on a computer by telling it to draw lines in particular positions. An advantage of a <em>vector graphic</em> is that it can be enlarged or reduced in size without loss of sharpness or distortion. Most modern image creation and edtiting packages can save images in vector graphic format. Vector graphics can be contrasted with <em>bit-mapped graphics</em>, which are made of a fixed number of pixels (small dots), and therefore sharpness may be lost when the image is resized.</p>
<p><em>Vodcast</em> A contraction of Video Podcast. A type of Podcast1 that incoporates video as well as audio.</p>
<h3 id="w"><em>W</em></h3>
<p><em>WAV (Waveform Audio Format)</em> A format for storing high-quality audio files.</p>
<p><em>Word-processor</em> Probably the most widely used computer Application. Modern word-processors allow the user to create fine-looking documents including images, tables, photographs, and even sound and video recordings if they are to be viewed on screen rather than from the printed page. In many respects they are similar to <em>Desktop Publishing</em> applications. Word-processors normally include a spellchecker, a grammar checker, a style checker and a thesaurus, as well as tools for writing in HTML, the coding language used for producing Web pages.Word-processors have been widely used in teaching and learning foreign languages ever since they first appeared.</p>
<p><em>WWW (World Wide Web)</em> Usually referred to simply as the Web. This is the most powerful and fastest growing Internet service. The World Wide Web was the brainchild of Tim Berners-Lee, who in 1989 invented the HTML coding language that is the basis of the Web. The Web became a public service in 1993. It is a huge collection of resources of information, including learning materials, which is accessed by means of a computer program known as a Browser. The World Wide Web is only part of the Internet, but many people treat both terms as synonyms.</p>
<p><em>WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)</em> Dates back to the pre-Windows and pre-Mac period, when what you saw on the screen, e.g. in a Word document, was not necessarily what appeared on your Printer - something we now take for granted.</p>
<h3 id="x"><strong>X</strong></h3>
<p><em><a href="id:XML">XML</a> (eXtensible Markup Language)</em> XML is a specification emanating from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows Web designers to create their own language for displaying documents on the Web. XML is an extension to the standard language for creating Web pages, HTML, and makes it possible to create websites containing more complex interactivity.</p>
<p><em><a href="id:XHTML">XHTML</a>(Extensible Hypertext Markup Language)</em> A markup language mainly used to produce websites. It generally has the same characteristics as HTML, but has a stricter syntax which allow it to be easily read by an XML-parser.</p>

<p>The project for NAI/010 Publishers has two technical components. A mobile web application, called My Highlights, allowing a user to browse a large collection and create an EPUB based on a personal selection of objects from this collection. The other is a set of WordPress plugins, extending the functionality of the WordPress JSON REST <strong>API</strong> (WP-AP)<a href="#fn97" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> and facilitate the generation of EPUBs using the content from a WordPress database. The latter is basically a packaged version of the CakePHP EPUB component that builds on Asbj√∏rn Grandt's PHPePub.</p>
<p>My Highlights on GitHub.<a href="#fn98" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="valiz">Valiz</h2>

<li id="fn92"><p>Take for example the 528 pages (10,8 x 17,48 cm) thick anthology <em>What will be / Ce qui sera / Lo que ser√° </em> Almanac of the international surrealist movement, with more than 170 contributors from 25 countries. Essays, poems, images, manifestoes, a debate on surrealist editions, chronology of 50 years of surrealism 1964-2014. Downloading such a book is problematic because you need a complete structured index and advanced search option. Printing it locally is almost impossible given the small fixed page size. Buying it at lulu.com gives you a POD on standard glossy paper, which is certainly not in line with the surrealist tradition.<a href="#fnref92">‚Ü©</a></p></li>
